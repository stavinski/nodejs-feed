It seems to mostly be there if you want to have multiple<em>writers</em>using different processes. That is a very interesting model for an embedded database, I’ve to admit.

The following structure is holding data about a db.</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_2297/image_4.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_2297/image_thumb_1.png\" width=\"631\" height=\"229\"></a></p><p>This is actually somewhat misleading, at least with regards to how I would think about a db. This is the entry point for all the pages that belong to a specific db. But a db in LMDB is not really the same thing as a db in SQL Server or RavenDB. It all reside in the same file, and you always have at least two. The first one is the free db, which is used to track all the free pages. The second one is the main db. Then you have additional, named databases.</p><p>This is used here:</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_2297/image_6.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_2297/image_thumb_2.png\" width=\"735\" height=\"363\"></a></p><p>This define the metadata for the entire environment. Note that we have the two dbs there in mm_dbs. The mm_txnid denotes the last committed transaction id. This value is what gives LMDB its MVCC support.  The mm_last_pg value is the last used page, any transaction that wants to write will start writing at that value.</p><p>Let us see how we deal with pages here, shall we?</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_2297/image_8.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_2297/image_thumb_3.png\" width=\"638\" height=\"706\"></a></p><p>The first part find try to find a dirty page if we are in a read/write transaction and we haven’t specify that we can write directly to memory. This is done by doing a binary search on the list of dirty pages.</p><p>Otherwise, we can just hand the user the actual page by accessing it directly.</p><p>Next, let us look where this is actually used. Searching for a page with a specific key in it. This is done mostly in mdb_node_search.</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_2297/image_12.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_2297/image_thumb_5.png\" width=\"497\" height=\"41\"></a></p><p>This seems to be doing a binary search for the keys inside a specific page (in this case, the page that is at the top of the stack on the cursor). That leads to the conclusion that pages internally have data internally stored as sorted arrays.</p><p>And this leads me to another pet peeve with this code base. Take a look at this line:</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_2297/image_14.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_2297/image_thumb_6.png\" width=\"309\" height=\"54\"></a></p><p>Sure, this is a well known trick to cheaply divide  a number by half, but are you seriously telling me that the compiler isn’t going to optimize  (low + high) / 2 ? To my knowledge, no C compiler updated in the last 10 – 15 years managed to miss this optimization. So why write code that is going to be harder to read?</p><p>Okay, so now we know how we search for a specific key inside a page, but how do we get to the actual page that we want to search on? This happens on mdb_page_search_root. Let me see if I can take it apart.</p><p>When this method is called, the cursor is setup so the first page on the pages stack is the root page. </p><p>And… that is enough for me. Up until now, I have been trying to just read the code. Not execute it, not debug through it, nothing .Just go over the code one line at a time and figure out what is going on. I actually think that I have a really good grasp about what is going on in there, but I think that this is pretty much all I can do at that point from just reading the code. So I am going to stop now and setup an debug environment so I can work with it, and report my finding from stepping through the code.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/9T7FEn5I3ns\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":99}}

The moment that you have a restart, all the data is gone. The is actually how several databases are running, but for now, we are going to assume that this is not desirable. The question now becomes, how do you actually store the data on disk?</p><p>This really becomes a pretty complex question, because you need to store the data on disk in a way that is crash safe, allow updates, and doesn’t take all the disk space in the world. Before we will get to the actual on disk data structures, we need to discuss how we implement persistent logs. Persistent logs are the key way that databases gets Durability. And as it turned out, there are just two ways of doing that that I am aware of:</p><ul><li>Append only</li><li>Transaction log</li></ul><p>Append only models rely on the fact that you only append to create a safe way to ensure that the data is either all in or all out. When we write, we don’t overwrite values, we are creating new values, and then we write where the last log entry is located. In CouchDB, for example, this is done by modifying the header portion of the file to point to the new data. In LMDB this is done by updating the page listing with the new pages. In both cases, you actually commit a transaction when the on disk pointer is changed to point to the new data. If you crash midway, nothing bad happened, you didn’t update the on disk pointer, it is still pointing at the old location. Worst case scenario, you wasted some disk space, and you probably have a way to reclaim that anyway.</p><p>Transaction logs use a different way to handle this. They are also usually implemented as append only files, into which we write the new data. Afterward, we can apply those changes in memory / on disk safely. A crash would simply mean having to replay the log. This is how leveldb, for example, works. This is also the essential idea behind how SQL Server Oracle works. Although in their case I believe that the transaction log usually contain both prev/new state of the pages they changed for a specific transaction.</p><p>One thing that you have to be aware of, either way, is that you should be prepared to handle scenarios where your process crashed midway, or when your entire machine had the plug pulled out. That means using fsync, sure, but it also means that you might have to do log replay, or be ready to see if you can recover something from the append only model.</p><p>The good thing about the transaction log approach is that after you have committed the changes to the standard persistent format, you can clear it (usually by just creating a new file and deleting the old one). With the append only model, you usually have to run some sort of compaction to clear things out. Note that the transaction log model vs append only model doesn’t really mean about how the<em>rest</em>of the persistent data is actually stored. We will touch on that on the next post.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/3DzG8Ok7Vl0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":101}}

And it is quite an interesting topic.</p><p>A memory mapped file is a feature for all modern operating system. It require coordination between the memory manager and the I/O subsystem. Basically, you can tell the OS that some file is the backing store for a certain portion of the process memory. In order to understand that, we have to understand virtual memory.</p><p>Here is your physical memory, using 32 bits for ease of use:</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/On-Memory-Mapped-Files_12152/image_4.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/On-Memory-Mapped-Files_12152/image_thumb_1.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"218\"></a></p><p>Now, you have two processes that are running. Each of them get their own 4 GB address space (actually, only 2 GB is available to the process in 32 bits, but that is good enough). What happen when both of those processes obtain a pointer to 0x0232194?</p><p>Well, what actually happens is that the pointer that looks like a pointer to physical memory is actually a virtual pointer, which the CPU and the OS work together to map to physical memory. It is obvious from the image that there is a problem here, what happens if two processes uses 4GB each? There isn’t enough physical memory to handle that. This is the point were the page file gets involved. So far, this is pretty basic OS 101 stuff.</p><p>The next stuff is where it gets interesting. So the OS already knows how to evict pages from memory and store them on the file system, because it needs to do that for the page file. The next step is to make use of that for more than just the page file. So you can map any file into your memory space. Once that is done, you can access the part of the memory you have mapped and the OS will load the relevant parts of the file to memory. Again, pretty basic stuff so far.</p><p>You can read about this more<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810613.aspx\">in this article</a>.</p><p>The reason you want to do this sort of thing is that it gives you the ability to work with files as if it was memory. And you don’t have to worry about all that pesky file I/O stuff. The OS will take care of that for you.</p><p>And now, to Tobi’s questions:</p><ul><li><strong>What are the most important advantages and disadvantages?</strong></li></ul><p>Probably the most important is that you don’t have to do manual file I/O. That can drastically reduce the amount of work you have to do, and it can also give you a pretty significant perf boost. Because the I/O is actually being managed by the operation system, you gain a<em>lot</em>of experience in optimizing things. And the OS will do things like give you a page buffer, caching, preloading, etc.  It also make it<em>drastically</em>easier to do parallel I/O safely, since you can read/write from “memory” concurrently without having to deal with complex API.</p><p>The disadvantages you need to be aware that things like the base addresses would change whenever you re-open the file, and that data structures that are good in memory might not result in good performance if they are stored on disk.</p><p>Another problem relates to how the changes actually are saved to the file. It is hard to make sure that the writes you do are coherently stored in the file system. For example, let us say that you made changes to two different memory locations, which reside on two different pages. The OS can decide, at any time, to take one of those pages away from you because it needs that memory for other things. When that happens, it will write that page to disk for you. So when you ask for it the next time, it can load it up again and the application won’t notice.</p><p>However, what would happen during a crash? You might have partially written data in that scenario. Usually, when writing to files using file I/O routines, you have very predictable write pattern. When you use memory mapped files for writes, you don’t know for sure in what order that is going to happen. The OS is free to choose that. There are ways you can control that. For example, you might use<strong>FILE_MAP_COPY</strong>to avoid the OS writing stuff for you, but you would have to handle writes yourself now, and that is<em>decidedly</em>not trivial.</p><p>You can use something like FlushViewOfFilew() to make sure that a specific range is flushed, but that still doesn’t mean that they will be written in any order that you might expect. As a db writer, I care, quite deeply, about the exact way the data is written to file, because otherwise it is really hard to reason about how to read it back. Especially when you have to consider failures and corruptions.</p><p>Personally, I would be writing stuff using memory mapped file for data that I needed critical stuff for.</p><ul><li><strong>Why are using well known products like SQL Server custom caches instead of memory mappings?</strong></li></ul><p>SQL Server is actually its own operating system. It managed memory, locks, threads, I/O and a lot more. That comes from the fact that for a long time, it<em>had</em>to do those sort of things. But note that SQL Server probably use memory mapped file quite a lot. But they are also using their own custom caches because it make sense to them. For example, query plan cache. Even when you do have memory mapped files, you usually have multiple layers of caching.</p><p>In RavenDB, for example, we have the native page cache (managed by Esent), the documents cache (managed by RavenDB) and the client cache. The reason that we have multiple layers is that we cache different things. The client cache avoid having to call the server. The documents cache avoid having to parse documents and the native page cache avoid having to go to disk.</p><ul><li><strong>Why are other products like LevelDB using mmap instead of custom caches?</strong></li></ul><p>Because they are drastically simpler products. They really want to just give you the data as quickly as possible, and they don’t need to do additional processing of the data. They can lean on the OS page cache to a much larger extent. Note that when use in real products, there are often higher level caches that they will use anyway, used for storing processed / parsed information.</p><ul><li><strong>Are they well suited for managed code?</strong></li></ul><p>Memory Mapped Files are usually harder to use from managed code, because we don’t do our own memory management. It does meant that you lose the benefit of just treating this as part of your memory space, because there is a very clear line between managed memory and native memory, and memory mapped files are on the other side of the hatch. That said, you can easily use them via UnmanagedMemoryStream, or read from them directly via Memory Accessor. The managed implementation for leveldb make heavy use of memory mapped files.</p><ul><li><strong>How does performance compare with other techniques?</strong></li></ul><p>It is generally better, mostly because the OS is really good in managing paging, and that you rely directly on the low level I/O routines. Another thing that you have to remember that if you use file I/O, you need to create a buffer, copy to/from that buffer, etc. Using memory mapped files saves all of that.</p><ul><li><strong>Is it possible to use them with mutable data structures and retain crash recoverability?</strong></li></ul><p>Yes, but… is probably the best answer. Yes, you can use them for mutable data, but you really want to be careful about how you do it. In particular, you need to make sure that you write in such a way that you can survive partial writes. A good way of doing that is to make writes to specific pages, and you “commit” by recording that those pages are now available on a metadata page, or something like that. This require a lot of really careful work, to be honest. Probably more work than you would like it to be. LMDB does it this way, and even if the code wasn’t a eye tearing pain, what it is doing is quite hard.</p><p>Note that in order to actually be sure that you a flushing to disk, you have to call<em>both</em>FlushViewOfFile and FlushFileBuffers on Windows.</p><ul><li><strong>What guarantees does the OS make regarding ordering and durability?</strong></li></ul><p>Pretty much none regarding ordering, as noted. Windows will guarantee that if both FlushViewOfFile and FlushFileBuffers  have been called and successfully completed, you are golden. But there aren’t any promises in the API about what will happen for partway failures, or in what order this happens.</p><p><strong>To summarize:</strong></p><p>Memory mapped files are a great tool, and for reads, they are excellent. For writes, they are awesome, but since there is no way to ensure in what order dirty pages gets written to disk, it make it hard to generate reliable system using them.</p><p>I rather use standard file I/O for writes, since that is far more predictable.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/QsLBLFDG4e8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":102}}

We got 3 of the 4.</p><p>The DB is:</p><ul><li>Atomic, since change will either go in or be rejected.</li><li>Consistent, you can’t see changes half way.</li><li>Isolated, one change can’t modify/view another.</li></ul><p>It isn’t durable, because everything is in memory.</p><p>It even has transactions, in the sense that a change goes in or not in an atomic fashion.</p><p>But, I think you’ll agree, this is very much a poor man’s solution. And those only apply just as long as you need to work with just a single item. In practice, you would usually want to make a lot more than that.</p><p>The basic properties you want is the ability to do multi item transactions, so you can modify two items at the same time, and they either go in or not at all. And that is where it gets<em>really</em>  complex, because at that point we need to build our own way to handle atomic updates to multiple values, how to keep them isolated and how to handle this consistently.</p><p>There aren’t really simple way to handle that, especially if we want to handle concurrent transactions. You would have to make a lot of decisions all of a sudden. For example, what happens if you have two concurrent transactions trying to update the same value. Is one of them rejected? And if so, at what point? Initial write? Commit time?</p><p>And that is just the start.</p><ul><li>Do you allow a transaction to live across multiple requests?</li><li>How do you handle transaction expiration?</li><li>Do you need to have a transaction span more than one node?

Either an append only model or a transaction log. In both cases, concurrent transactions make it… interesting to figure out how to properly write to the log. And the moment that you have either option, you have to build in some form of a recovery tool for system or db crashes. You have better also love fsync, since it is a very important tool in making sure that you can actually get durable transactions.</p><p>Oh, and of course, I forgot, if we allow long running transactions…</p><ul><li>Who can read the yet uncommitted value? Everyone? Just the current transaction? Can you explicitly ask to see uncommitted value?</li><li><em>How</em>do you allow it to be read?</li><li>Is it available for queries?</li></ul><p>This is usually the most touchy part in the system, since is so critical. It is also something that you have to take into account in pretty much the entire codebase.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/uIJv78paA9Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":103}}

Mostly because this was my reaction when I read the post.</p><p><img src=\"http://www.wrongway.org/wrongway.jpg\" /></p><p>Basically, the premise is wrong. The user have a document like“config/tax-rates”, and when they create an order, they need to make sure that the tax rate hasn’t changed. I am assuming here that“time between edit started& committed” is relatively low, counted in milliseconds, and that there isn’t any human involvement in this process.</p><p>The reason this is wrong is the following sequence of events (T+1 is time + 1 ms):</p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"646\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"378\">Scenario #1</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"266\">Scenario #2</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"378\"><ul><li>T +0– read referenced doc</li><li>T +1– create order</li><li>T +2– config/tax-rates changed</li><li>T +3– save order</li><li>T +4– concurrency error because the config/tax-rates changed</li></ul></td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"266\"><ul><li>T +0– read referenced doc</li><li>T +1– create order</li><li>T +2– save order</li><li>T +3– save order completed</li><li>T +4– config/tax-rates changed</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p>According to the question above, both scenarios are absolutely correct ways for the system to behave. In practice, scenario #2 is wrong (probably).</p><p>Udi Dahan has wrote about this a lot, but I can’t find the appropriate article at this time. <strong>Update: </strong><a href=\"http://www.udidahan.com/2010/08/31/race-conditions-dont-exist/\">http://www.udidahan.com/2010/08/31/race-conditions-dont-exist/</a></p><p>If it actually matter enough for scenario #1 to require an error, scenario #2 is also invalid. This isn’t a technical issue, it is a business issue. If you failed to update the tax rate after you were notified, you are responsible for it, right? Except that there is no way that this works. Tax changes usually take place at midnight, and are announced several days / weeks in advanced, at a minimum. And even if you were in a total news blackout, you are<em>still</em>responsible for the rate change, even if you never heard about it.</p><p>The way this is setup is simply wrong. You don’t try to stop orders from being processed, because you are going to miss the just completed order. Instead, you are going to do compensation logic to fix any changes that apply.</p><p>You can also tell that this is the case by the fact that this is actually pretty hard to do. Documents are independent from one another. The best way to work with such a scenario is to record the time (or the etag) when you made a decision based on a related document, then at a later point in time, you can make a decision based on whatever it changed, how old it is, etc.</p><p><em>That</em>gives you proper frame of mind, not trying to count milliseconds.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/38sLNg5NVIc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":105}}

Okay, I did some more figuring out and I think that I know where I went wrong. The codebase appears to be trying small enough to fit into the CPU caches, in order to do that, they decided to make it hard enough to make sure it won’t fit into<em>my</em>cache. But I’m trying to work through that.<p>One of the things that I figured out was that I made a mistake, I kept thinking about databases in the same way you’ll see in RavenDB or SQL Server, as complete separate items. Instead, LMDB does something quite different. It basically uses a single file for everything. This is called the environment, and that can contains named dbs. If you have multiple databases, all of them are going to reside in the same file. The way it works, it creates a file and then map it into memory. On Windows, it actually allocate the space for the file upfront (which doesn’t appears to be necessary).<p>But the basic idea is that you need to specify upfront the size of the file you want, and that is the maximum data size you have. This can change, but only if you close the environment and start it up again with a higher value. This also explains why you have to specify the number of databases you want to have per environment.  Once you created the environment, everything else become an issue of just managing the pages. In particular, because LMDB only allows a single writer, it doesn’t really have to worry about concurrency issues. It has mapped all the data into memory, and then it is just a matter of creating the appropriate data structure.<p>A lot of the code is dedicated to managing pages of data, and now that I have gone through enough of the codebase to be sure that I sort of have a vague idea about what is going on I can still say that I think that this is way denser than it should. And I shudder to think what it would take to make any sort of change to this codebase.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/Vl0GBYDAHfw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":106}}

RavenDB actually uses something very similar to that for concurrency control for writes, although the RavenDB ETag mechanism is alos doing a lot more.</p><p>But the version system that we have above is actually not enough, it only handle concurrency control for<em>updates</em>. What about concurrency controls for<em>reads</em>?</p><p>In particular, how are we going to handle non repeatable reads or phantom reads?</p><ul><li>Non repeatable reads happen when you are reading a value, it is then deleted, and when you try to read it again, it is gone.</li><li>Phantom read is the other way around, first you tried, but didn’t find anything, then it was created, and you read it again and find it.</li></ul><p>This is actually interesting, because you only care about those for the duration of a single operation / transaction / session. As it stand now, we actually have no way to handle either issue. This can lead to… interesting bugs that only happen under very specific scenarios.</p><p>With RavenDB, we actually handle both cases. In a session lifetime, you are<em>guaranteed</em>that if you saw a document, you’ll continue to see this document until the end of the session, which deals with the issue of non repeatable read. Conversely, if you<em>didn’t</em>see a document, you will continue to not see it until the session is closed. This is done for Load, queries are a little bit different.</p><p>Another aspect of concurrency that we need to deal with is Locking. Sometimes a user has a really good reason why they want to lock a record for a period of time. This is pretty much the only way to handle “checking out” of a record in a scenario where you have to multiple users wanting to make changes to a record concurrently. Locks can be Write Or ReadWrite locks. A Write lock allows users to read the data, but prevent them from changing that. When used in practice, this is usually going to immediately fail an operation, rather than make you wait for it.</p><p>The reasoning behind immediate fail for write is that if you encountered a record with a write lock, it means that it was either already written to or is about to be written to. At that case, your write is going to be operating on stale data, so we might was well fail you immediately. For ReadWrite locks, the situation is a bit different. In this case, we want to also prevent readers from moving on. This is usually done to ensure consistent state system wise, and basically, any operation on the record would have to wait until the lock is removed.</p><p>In practice,ReadWrite locks can cause a<em>lot</em>of issues. The moment that you have people start placing locks, you have to deal with lock expiration, manual unlocking, abandoned lock detection, lock maintenance, etc. About the only thing that they are good for is to allow the user to make a set of changes and present them as one unit, if we don’t have better transaction support. But I’ll discuss that in another post. In the meantime, just keep in mind that from my point of view, ReadWrite locks are pretty useless all around.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/U74D6EWLGmA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":109}}

The codebase is really simple, which is pretty much the point, but can you think about the implications of the current codebase with regards to memory?</p><p>All the data is kept in a ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string,byte[]&gt;, and there is an unspoken assumption. Both keys and values are assumed to be small. What happens if that isn’t the case? Well, in .NET, you are going to get memory fragmentation pretty quickly. That means that on 32 bits, you are probably going to be able to store a<em>lot</em>less than the 2 GB of virtual memory that you get from the OS.</p><p>We will ignore that as well and move to other aspects of the code. What about how the system actually work in production? There is a<em>lot</em>of work that goes into ensuring that the CPU will be able to access memory efficiently. In particular, most dbs uses some form of an in memory data structure that take advantage of the L1, L2, L3 cache of the CPU. Usually something like a B+Tree. How does the dictionary compare here?</p><p>For that matter, what happens when we grow really big? What about when we are paging? How would<em>that</em>work? Can we just go over the keys in the dictionary without having to page through the values as well?</p><p>And…</p><p>I think that you get my drift by now. And this is literally just me throwing stuff off the top of my head. There are a lot of other things that we need to worry about. For example, if we implement the sensible notion of a buffer pool, we might actually have a buffer that was released by a write but is currently being sent to the client, so we can’t just use buffers, we have to use ref counting as well.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/-VI2C34Caz4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":110}}

It uses memory-mapped files, so it has the read performance of a pure in-memory database while still offering the persistence of standard disk-based databases.</p></blockquote><p>It has some interesting feature set, and a really small codebase. I am anxious to see how they managed to do so much.</p><p>Interestingly, the data model for LMDB is quite different from the usual append-only / transaction log. Instead, it allows only a single concurrent writer, and modify the data in place. There also appears to be a lot of dire warnings regarding usage of long transactions, since they would result in increased file size, presumably because the db couldn’t find the pages the scavenge because they are locked by ongoing transactions.</p><p>One thing that I should note already, the code (I am currently about 1/3 of the way of lmdb.h file) is very well commented, and it explains a lot about what is going on. If the rest of the code is like that, this is going to be really nice to read. Okay, I take it back. The main files seems to be lmdb.h and mdb.c. The first one is 1,300 lines and the second is over 7,500 lines. Admittedly, this is impressive in the sense that pretty much everything is done there, and there are a lot of docs. But<em>damn</em>, I wish this was better organized. Right now my head feels like I need to pop up and take a breath.</p><p>I read ~2,000 lines of code so far, and I haven’t found<em>anything</em>that does something. It is all headers or comments or macros up until now. I skipped over to the code, and it is really hard to understand what is going on.</p><p>Take this code snippet:</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_923A/image_2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_923A/image_thumb.png\" width=\"540\" height=\"234\"></a></p><p>It shows a lot of the things that make it hard to work with. effectively random naming convention (under_score, Pascal_naming, SHOUT_NAMING, etc), the goto trick is used WAY too much, lovely variable names such as n2. This is part of a method that goes on for something like 150 – 200 lines. And it include the following code:</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_923A/image_4.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_923A/image_thumb_1.png\" width=\"485\" height=\"246\"></a></p><p>Quick, can you tell me how many variables are declared here? And note that they are all<em>local</em>variables. I counted it twice, once getting to 17 and once getting 18.</p><p>That is just too much, I am not going to go any deeper. The leveldb codebase was easy to follow, it had<em>structure</em>. This codebase is just a code dump. It might be a really good codebase, for what it needs to do, but I literally can’t follow it.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/jp7XBaFO6qA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":111}}

It is Onion Architecture for Distributed Systems.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>Onion Architecture is an architectural pattern for keeping libraries and dependencies on the extremities of a software system while building a strong and cohesive system core.  Distributed systems like those that leverage NServiceBus and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) products have characteristics that challenge layering principles of non-distributed systems.  This session will show how to properly structure and layer a .Net/C# software system that makes use of Onion Architecture, NServiceBus, and ASP.NET MVC.  The target audience for this session is:  C#, architect, senior engineer, team leads/lead developers.</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>If you are interested in speaking at the Code Camp, please submit a talk. <a href=\"http://codecamp13.adnug.org/speakers.html\">http://codecamp13.adnug.org/speakers.html</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.jeffreypalermo.com/~ff/jeffreypalermo?a=ekLQzgxBVE8:xDeAanTa1JQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/jeffreypalermo?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.jeffreypalermo.com/~ff/jeffreypalermo?a=ekLQzgxBVE8:xDeAanTa1JQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/jeffreypalermo?i=ekLQzgxBVE8:xDeAanTa1JQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/jeffreypalermo/~4/ekLQzgxBVE8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Jeffrey Palermo","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":118}}

Some people are practicing TDD, but I think that’s only 46 people in the world and <a href=\"http://poll.pollcode.com/pdolm_result?v\">they all follow my twitter feed</a>.</p><p>&lt;/attention-seeking-headlines&gt;</p><p>We all know the common issues people have with writing large test harnesses around systems: it seems to take a long time, existing code is difficult to test, subsequent changes to code makes a lot of existing tests fail or become redundant, and the test harnesses often can become brittle, in no small part because of the abusive use of mocking.</p><p>As a recovering TDD addict, I used to tell people, like many others do, that the issue with their TDD was that they didn’t do it right. If TDD is too hard, do more TDD! In other words, if it hurts, just bang that leg with that baseball bat a bit harder, eventually you will not hurt anymore.</p><p>I will come straight out with it: this approach to unit, integration and tdd testing has, by far and large, failed. It’s over. It is time to move on. I have, and I now do <strong>VE</strong>rtical <strong>S</strong>lice <strong>T</strong>esting.</p><h2>A law of diminishing returns</h2><p>Whatever your test coverage, there is a point where more tests don’t equate more quality. Actually, let me be entirely honest here, I do not believe that a good test harness leads to better perceived quality software for your <strong>users</strong>.</p><p>The people you are trying to please with a good test harness are the ones using your system that are not on a high bandwidth medium with you. Usually that would be your team. To reduce the risk of them experiencing issues, and to increase the chance of them liking your software, you write tests so that their experience is positive.</p><p>A long time ago, I realized that testing everything is not always feasible for me, and I practice TDD all the time. A quick mental review of the teams I worked with in the last 12 years I’ve been practicing TDD also tells me that this fact is rather general.</p><h2>Mocking considered evil</h2><p>I’ve never been a big fan of mocking frameworks, for one simple reason. Simple stubbing relies on assumptions on the functioning of the mocked part of your system that rarely match reality, for no one is going to look at all the documentation of an API and decompile the code when writing a one-line stub.</p><p>As you progress in your implementation, you may learn about more scenarios you didn’t cover, and provided you are in that tiny little fraction of a percent of people refactoring your test harness as you progress your implementation, you may feedback some of that knowledge in previous tests you wrote and in your test doubles, while caressing your pet unicorn and enjoying a bit of sunshine on planet <a href=\"http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Equestria\">Equestria</a>. Or if you’re like the rest of us, you probably won’t.</p><h2>Increasing returns for user interfaces</h2><p>Admitting to myself that I could not fix those problems (<em>you cant fix stupid!)</em>, I started trying to understand how I could bring some of the TDD practices I enjoyed (fast feedback, repeatable tests, etc) while increasing the perception of quality, leaving any theoretical or coverage notions behind me. Instead of starting from the components I want to put under test, I start with what my users, hum, <strong>use</strong>.</p><p>If I provide users with an API, I will start by the API that I decide to publish, and consider everything else implementation details. I will only document and polish, a.k.a. test, what <strong>other people</strong> may use.</p><p>All the same, if my user interface is not an API, but some sort of UI, there is very little reason to care about all the scenarios a component may face that <strong>cannot</strong> be triggered from that user interface.</p><p>The process of discovering your user interface has an added advantage. The answer to most <em>but what if</em> questions about such a top-down approach usually unveils an additional user interface you didn’t quite know you had (looking at you, JSON SPA AJAX <em>&lt;insert buzz word of the day&gt;</em> Frankenstein “web” apps).</p><p>This is already an understood concept, and is usually referred to as acceptance testing.</p><h2>At warp speed, everything is relative</h2><p>A common issue arises from using existing acceptance-driven tools. Automating the browser is slow, automating a DB is as well, so is the file system. Each of those may also fail for reasons that have nothing to do with your code.</p><p>That would make your tests brittle and slow, which inexorably will lead to longer feedback cycles, harder to run tests, which would get us straight back to my introduction and why traditional approaches to TDD have failed.</p><p>Acceptance testing recommends, to avoid such a problem, the creation of an alternative interface allowing you to remove the browser from the equation. This is no longer necessary. With tools such as <a href=\"http://zombie.labnotes.org/\">zombie</a> being available for free, you can run an in-memory browser that behaves like a browser, runs in-memory and is increadibly fast. No more Selenium issues on running your automated test suite, no interaction with your operating system’s UI library, it’s all fast and beautiful. And if your user interface is an API, unit testing frameworks and test runners have provided those advantages for many, many years.</p><p><strong>External-facing</strong> components are now in-memory, making executing our tests fast and reliable by not triggering external systems.</p><p>I now apply the same concept to <strong>internal facing components.</strong> Instead of mocking out the inner-most elements, such as the file system, the network or a database, of my system on a per-method or per-component basis, I use libraries that give me, out of the box, an in-memory version of their system that is <strong>functionally equivalent</strong> to the real one.</p><p>It means an in-memory file system would implement the same locking primitives as the real systems, the same rules around reading, writing or seeking data, and be as close as the author of the library can make it to the real system.</p><p>In other words, a VEST-friendly library turns the unit tests of that library on it’s head. The component accessing external systems is developed alongside it’s test-double variant, and both are built to react, error-out and validate calls in the same way. The <strong>test double can be shipped</strong>. I don’t write the mocks, they come as part of the package.</p><p>There are many advantages to such an approach. The author of the library knows intimately the contract he provided you as part of his API. The act of providing an in-memory version means this knowledge is now expressed explicitly, forcing error conditions (which are very much part of a user interface in an API) to be accounted for.</p><p>A VEST-friendly library will usually end up testing explicit contracts in their test harness, so we go one step further. A library author can ship the test harnesses that exercise the contract they expose for all the conditions that are known to potentially exist, and once again, we turn test code into shipping code: if the author has written a test harness, and the author builds two components implementing an interface, the <strong>test harness for the explicit public interfaces can be shipped</strong>, as it’s probably already written.</p><p>I believe this process to be recursive and leading to the pit of success, as any library built using VEST in mind will naturally feed the VEST approach.</p><h2>Vertical Slice Testing</h2><p>The VEST approach replaces all external system calls by functionally equivalent stable and controlled ones, both at the outer-most layer (whatever exercises the user interface) and the inner-most one (whatever touches the low-level IO APIs).</p><p>By using VEST, I can focus on delivering web pages or components that focus on user-interaction, I can run the whole system on every test, and do it very quickly. I can change a lot of inside internal code without breaking existing testing scenarios. And should I wish to implement components replacing the ones in my libraries, I can do that without writing tests, because the test harness is already there, testing the contract for me.</p><p><em>Note: As I’m abroad and not available that much, don’t expect quick answers in the comments section but I’ll try my best. Subjects not covered but not forgotten: my team as a user, availability of VEST libraries, code samples, library author burden, brown field projects, generic crazy-talk, unicorns not being ponies, “you never worked in a team!”, “in an ideal world…”, etc.</em></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CodeBetter/~4/h8y7KreYZsc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Sebastien Lambla","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":188}}

The configuration is always done using an instance of an HttpConfiguration object.

If you follow the previous link you’ll find some impressive visualizations made with d3 and SVG (the<a href=\"http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1256572\">d3 Show Reel</a>is just one example).</p><p>d3 is a bit jQuery-ish in the sense it can manipulate the DOM, select elements, and set attributes. For the work I was doing there are 2 distinguishing features of d3:</p><p>- d3 can join elements with data sources. The end result is similar to using a repeater with data binding.</p><p>- d3 can use a function to calculate attribute values instead of using hard coded values.</p><p>For example, let’s say we have the following data:.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var data =[{ name: \"Cost\" },{ name: \"Scope\" },{ name: \"Time\" }];</pre><p>We’ll combine the data with some d3 code:</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">d3.selectAll(\"p\").data(data).enter().append(\"p\").text(function(d) { return d.name });</pre><p>The d3 API takes some work to understand, but the above code reads like this:</p><p><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: right; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/Data-Visualization-With-d3.js_11D89/image_3.png\" width=\"93\" height=\"143\">1.

Then append a new paragraph to the document</p><p>5. And set the text of the paragraph to the name attribute of each data item</p><p>The result being that three new paragraphs will appear on the page using text from the data array. Of course this example is uninspiring and entirely boring, but also easy to understand.</p><h3>Layouts</h3><p>Another great feature of d3 are the<a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Layouts\">layouts</a>the library supports. The<a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout\">force layout</a>uses verlet integration (<a href=\"http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2012/07/26/swinging-on-a-canvas.aspx\">one of my favorites</a>) to constrain object positions. Let’s use the same data as earlier, but this time use SVG and a force layout to create the famous<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle\">iron triangle of project management</a>(but in this case a triangle that no matter how far you pull of the edges, the triangle will always rebalance itself).</p><p>First, we’ll need to augment our data with some links. d3 will process the source and target values in data links as array indexes into the data array and know that cost relates to scope, scope relates to time, and time relates to cost.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var data =[{ name: \"Cost\" },{ name: \"Scope\" },{ name: \"Time\" }];var dataLinks =[{ source: 0, target: 1 },{ source: 1, target: 2 },{ source: 2, target: 0 }];</pre><p>The next step is to create the force layout given an area of 960x500, keeping a distance of 220px between nodes, and maintaining a slight negative charge (repulsion) between elements. There is also a “game loop” setup using a tick function to update the screen (we’ll see it later).</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var force =d3.layout.force().size([960, 500]).nodes(data).links(dataLinks).linkDistance(220).charge(-20).on(\"tick\", tick);</pre><p>The layout is an abstraction in the sense it will set x and y properties on our data and link objects, but it is up to us to make something appear on the screen. So, we’ll use d3 to create an svg element in the document, then a&lt;line&gt; for each link, and a&lt;circle&gt; and&lt;text&gt; for each data element.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var svg = d3.select(\"body\").append(\"svg\").attr(\"width\", 960).attr(\"height\", 500);var links = svg.selectAll(\".link\").data(dataLinks).enter().append(\"line\").attr(\"class\", \"link\");var nodes = svg.selectAll(\".node\").data(data).enter().append(\"circle\").attr(\"class\", \"node\").attr(\"r\", 40).call(force.drag);var text = svg.selectAll(\".text\").data(data).enter().append(\"text\").attr(\"class\", \"text\").text(function (d) { return d.name; });force.start();</pre><p>As the force layout applies its logic it will update x and y properties on our data elements and links. Now it is our job to update all the lines, circles, and text elements on each tick loop with their associated values from the data objects. As objects are dragged around the screen, the force layout will continue to update these values.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">function tick() {links.attr(\"x1\", function (d) { return d.source.x; }).attr(\"y1\", function (d) { return d.source.y; }).attr(\"x2\", function (d) { return d.target.x; }).attr(\"y2\", function (d) { return d.target.y; });nodes.attr(\"cx\", function (d) { return d.x; }).attr(\"cy\", function (d) { return d.y; });text.attr(\"x\", function (d) { return d.x - 15; }).attr(\"y\", function (d) { return d.y + 5; }).text(function (d) { return d.name; });}</pre><p>The end result is the “perfect project manager” who always keeps the iron triangle perfectly balanced.</p><p><img title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Iron triangle with d3.js\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/Data-Visualization-With-d3.js_11D89/triangle_3.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"230\"></p><p>Try it for yourself at<a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/By5vH/3/\">http://jsfiddle.net/By5vH/3/</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?a=pWF6_5AbzrM:PEy2zo_u2eg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"scott@OdeTocode.com","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":204}}

Instead, I talk about building abstractions. Functions are abstractions, and objects are abstractions, too. When I was a student I would think that a hash table would be a perfectly reasonable abstraction for a shopping cart. I want today’s students to know the hash table can be an implementation detail and something you can encapsulate into a<em>better</em>abstraction for a shopping cart.</p><p>This course is about the single responsibility principle and the mantra of “design for use, not reuse”, although those words are never spoken verbatim. Knowing Big-O notation and how to work with pointers is incredibly important to build software correctly. But, I think those concepts receive too much of the spotlight in programming introductions, leaving many to believe, like I did, that you should solve every problem using lists of strings and numbers.</p><p>I hope everyone who watches enjoys the course and starts off with a better perspective on how to build software.</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?a=vtBTHvJKDJo:99uUehLkSBg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"scott@OdeTocode.com","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":205}}

The Workspace feature is<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">now available</span> not yet available in the stable builds of Chrome, but sounds like it will be soon. </p><h3>Getting Workspaces Setup</h3><p>The first step is to open the Settings panel by clicking the“gears” icon in the lower right of the tools window. Then select“Workspace”. Under“Folders” you can select one or more folder where your source lives, or even a parent folder like your parent folder for all git repositories. The Workspace features is fairly smart when it comes to finding source code files inside.</p><p><img style=\"float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/b16b5a984bfb_11DBB/wsaddfolder_5.png\" alt=\"Mapping Folders for Chrome Dev Tools Workspaces\" width=\"703\" height=\"414\" /></p><p>Theoretically you could select the root directory of a drive, but I’m not clear on the implications of granting access, and after selecting a folder you’ll have to say yes to a  popup warning about making sure you“do not expose sensitive information”. Until there is a definitive document (I couldn’t find one), I’d have to assume third party extensions would be able to poke around the file system looking for plaintext passwords inside of config files.</p><p>Once a file system location is mounted, you can start to edit files in the Sources tab of the developer tools. You can open and edit any text file from the file system tree in the Navigator window of the Sources panel, even non web files like build files or C# code.</p><p>Of course the files you will be most interested in editing are the JavaScript and CSS files that are loaded into the browser from a web application. You can“map” a file loaded into the browser to a file on the file system by right-clicking the file in the Navigator window and selecting the matching file on your hard drive.</p><p><img style=\"background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;\" title=\"\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/b16b5a984bfb_11DBB/maptorfile_3.png\" alt=\"Mapping browser files to the file system\" width=\"544\" height=\"451\" border=\"0\" /></p><p>Once that step is complete, you can now start editing the JavaScript and CSS of an application and have the changes saved (Ctrl+S) to your local file system.</p><h3>Where Workspaces Is Great</h3><p>For editing the CSS of an application, the Workspaces experience is unsurpassed by any other development environment. You get to see your live site running in the browser with live data. The changes you make in the CSS are instantly reflected in the browser, and when the UI looks good, pressing Ctrl+S will save your changes into your CSS file. You can edit the CSS file directly, but you can also edit CSS from the Elements pane for fine-tuning, and these changes are immediately persisted. It is the ultimate WYSIWYG designer.</p><p><img style=\"background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;\" title=\"\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/b16b5a984bfb_11DBB/cssedit_3.png\" alt=\"Editing CSS in Chrome Workspaces\" width=\"529\" height=\"412\" border=\"0\" /></p><p> </p><h3>Where Workspaces Is Good</h3><p>You can edit other files, too, like JavaScript files, but these generally require a refresh of the browser to see the changes running. For example, you can open up a file of Jasmine tests and create a new test, but running the test requires a refresh. It would be nice to have an option of automatic re-execution in the spirit of today’s automated test runners.</p><p>Obviously  a change to compiled code, like a C# file, requires a re-build outside of the browser and dev tools. It would be nice to have some hooks to do this automatically like some text editors can do.</p><h3>Where Workspaces Could Improve</h3><p>As for the Chrome Dev Tools becoming an everyday all day editor + IDE, it still has a ways to go. The tools have always behaved like a gifted but insubordinate child. Hitting backspace or enter at the wrong time can wipe out a style definition (fortunately Ctrl+Z undo can bring the style back), and the UI often feels cramped, jumbled (even on a big screen), and quirky (as I’m typing, an unlabeled checkbox has appeared in the middle of nowhere). The tools also feel transient, since closing the wrong browser tab will close the associated workspace, and the editing ability is still missing some key features provided by other editors, like columnar selection, auto-completion for CSS properties, and commands or triggers to interact with external tools.</p><p>Despite these shortcomings, the Chrome dev tools are still head and shoulders above the tools in other browsers. Plus, they get better with every frequent release.</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?a=H8RyEIgLdDc:KL7Jww_8ePA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"scott@OdeTocode.com","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":207}}

It was an anxious time to be on board at the nuke plant- the late 1990s. The dreaded Y2K loomed over all of their aging systems. One decimal point in the wrong spot at midnight on January 1st, 2000 and… well, nothing good would come of it.</p><p>Ulrich’s job for the big conversion was more benign though. He needed to update the simple graphics on the monitoring program the nuclear technicians used to keep tabs on the reactor. The very basic macro language generated Commodore 64-quality graphics; it displayed the position of the control rods, neutron flux, water temperatures& pressure, turbine and generator stats, and how many three-eyed fish were caught in the neighboring lake. All of this was then shown on 10 massive CRT monitors mounted around the main control room.</p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Nuclear.power.plant.Dukovany.jpg\" width=\"480\" style=\"float: right; margin: 8pt;\" /><p>Ulrich worked diligently to get his screens prepared, and the day came for him to roll out the changes. They didn’t have a“test control room”, so the demo needed to be run live. He invited the engineers to gather’round the monitors to see his spectacular new designs. When the program booted and Ulrich went to pull up the control rod screen, all 10 monitors went as black as the cloak on a member of the Night’s Watch. As the engineers chuckled, Ulrich turned bright red and ran back to the server room to see what happened. It didn’t take him long to realize that whatever he screwed up caused the entire mainframe to go down.</p><p>Thus began a two-week battle to troubleshoot the mainframe issue, during which time the computer monitoring was completely unavailable. This caused the nuclear technicians to have to leave their air conditioned control room so they could use primitive analog monitoring tools from the 1970’s to check on the reactor. Every time Ulrich walked past one of them, he could sense them glaring and thinking“There’s that little pipsqueak that killed the monitors!”</p><p>The tools Ulrich had to debug the program weren’t merely useless to him. They went beyond uselessness into outright opposition. The custom macro-language had no debugger or real documentation. The mainframe was purchased from the Czech Republic and one would have to know Czech in order to read the error logs. He was able to locate a sticker on top of the server with the phone number of the vendor. He was able to reach one of their‘experts’ named Miklos, who asked him for the serial number of the product. Ulrich provided it but the expert retorted“That is not full number! This is too short. What you need help with? Toaster? Coffee maker?”</p><p>Confused, Ulrich replied,“Ummm, a mainframe?” Had the nuclear plant bought their server from some sort of Czech Coffee, Toaster, and Mainframe Corp.? Miklos said“Oh no, Miklos can not help you. I give you number for Blazej. He does help with mainframe.” Blazej was an engineer at another nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic, who also had the same mainframe. Ulrich called there, not expecting much.</p><p>Through a series of conversations with Blazej, Ulrich was able to finally narrow down the problem to the presence of circles in the screen outputs. Apparently drawing fancy circles was far too much for the monitoring program to handle. He removed all the circles from his screens, uploaded the changes to the mainframe and finally the engineers could see the reactor statistics on the bright, beautiful monitors; without any circles. The result was ugly, boxy, and barely readable, but it<em>worked</em>. Ulrich breathed a sigh of relief then decided to call Czech Coffee, Toaster, and Mainframe Corp. back to notify them of the horrible bug in their program.</p><p>Ulrich once again got connected to his buddy Miklos.“Hi Miklos, this is Ulrich. I called a while back concerning our power plant monitoring program crashing the mainframe. You’ll be glad to know that Blazej and I were able to determine the problem. It all had to do with circles being drawn on the screen. I know it sounds silly, but that causes the whole mainframe to come down.”</p><p>Miklos seemed to be offended by such an accusation.“You do a circle and server come down? You want Miklos to fix this? You stupid? If you know circle cause trouble, then DO NOT USE CIRCLE!” Miklos abruptly hung up. Ulrich shrugged it off since his job was done. He eventually finished his undergrad program before Y2K and moved on from the nuclear power plant. When New Years 2000 rolled around, he made sure he was far, far away at a ski resort just in case anyone else slipped a circle into the graphics and the plant melted down as a result.</p><aside><small><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nuclear.power.plant.Dukovany.jpg\">Nuclear Reactor image from the public domain</a></small></aside><!-- The fact that it's a Czech reactor is a complete coincidence. --><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

He didn't make changes directly to production, dare the two-week-old butter chicken in the back of the lunchroom fridge, or even particularly<em>like</em>1986's Tom Cruise / Val Kilmer vehicle<em>Top Gun</em>. But as part of an elite development team that had split from Government Department's mainframe dev group, Chris couldn't help being branded \"other\". When he walked by, the old-school mainframe developers whispered: there went a guy who thought dangerously<em>out of the box</em>.</p><p>The original reason for the split was called<strong>The Internet</strong>. As the Thermodynamic Arrow of Time dragged them relentlessly towards the heat-death of the universe, Government Department needed a web presence and a modern intranet. While the budgetary committee would have been perfectly happy to somehow run the new system on the Department's existing mainframes, sanity prevailed (this time) and a new-ish PC server machine landed on Chris's doorstep. Since a majority of the senior-most developers wanted nothing to do with the newfangled equipment, the PC / Server Team was formed. While having perhaps not as much experience as the mainframe developers, Chris and co. knew their server needed an uninterruptible power supply and regular disaster-recovery testing. Every quarter, at a scheduled time, they would pull the plug on the UPS and ensure the server shut down gracefully before the batteries died. And the server<em>always</em>did.</p><p>Everything was fine until that pesky Arrow of Time saw fit to move Government Department forward a couple years and into new offices. The \"mainframe\" support team had since added (or, some said, been<em>forced</em>to add) modern servers to their roster, running things like their new helpdesk system. Though the PC / Server Team and their senior counterparts remained separate in mind, body, and certainly in coding conventions, their hardware huddled close together in the new office's compact server room. All was well... for a few months. When quarterly testing time arrived, Chris pulled the plug on their UPS. As expected, their server logged the UPS warning messages and did a proper shutdown. Once the batteries were flat, Chris would record the maximum emergency window provided by the UPS, and he was just reaching for his logbook when he heard the screaming.</p><p>The mainframe support team poured into the server room, looming over Chris. Their systems were crashing! What had he done?!</p><p>It was a tense moment, but Chris - that maverick - answered a question with a question: had they plugged a server into his team's UPS? They had: three of them, in fact. After all, the three empty outlets on the power supply, blaze orange as they were, looked so inviting. And, Chris - thinking outside the box - followed with another question, had they installed UPS-monitoring software on those servers? They had not. So while Chris's server had realized it was on battery power and began its shutdown sequence, theirs had cheerfully dawdled until darkness fell.</p><p>That was how Chris wound up giving Government Department's senior developers a riveting Powerpoint presentation on how to properly use a UPS with their servers. After the talk, one of the mainframe gurus stopped Chris and shook his hand.</p><p>\"You're still dangerous, maverick... but you can be my wingman any time.\"</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

Men behaved savagely, both financially and socially. Women, no matter their skill and/or rank, were objects, targets ripe for abuse. Fast forward a few decades into the PC era and the madness was scaled back quite a bit, but the characters remained. The off-color jokes and emails are still passed around; just more discretely. Right or wrong, it's just the way the business side has always been in large financial firms.</p><p>One day, Chris received an email from the CTO asking him to consider the attached resume for the open position on his team. The resume looked decent, and the level of business knowledge the candidate would bring to the team would be extremely helpful, so Chris decided to reply and set up an interview. As he hit<i>reply</i>, Chris noticed that the email had been forwarded from the broker to the CTO; it was initially a series of exchanges between the candidate and broker who were obviously buddies, so he decided to read it all, starting from the bottom up.</p><p>After some friendly banter between the candidate and the broker, the discussion took a seedier turn. The broker had asked how his vacation to eastern Europe had gone. Details were proffered about the girls he met, the acts they performed and the pictures he took. Perhaps a normal exchange between friends or co-workers, but certainly inappropriate as part of an email introducing a candidate for a job.</p><p>Now there were no inter-species acts. No animals or virgins were sacrificed. It was just someone cutting loose on a once-in-a-lifetime vacation. Let's face it, when you come back from vacation, especially an exotic one, those around you invariably ask for details and everybody obliges.</p><p>Of course, leaving those details and pictures in an email being used to introduce a candidate was a serious breach of etiquette by the broker, but how many times have each of us simply kept replying to an email, long after the conversation has changed from the original subject matter? Or forwarding it to others? It's pretty obvious that the broker didn't bother to think about the contents of the email all the way to the bottom. It's equally obvious the CTO just read the top paragraph and forwarded it on.</p><p>Chris decided that since the material was left in the email, he would pass on a potentially decent candidate because the broker who recommended him was careless. Pity; he could have shown the email the broker sent to the CTO to the candidate on  the interview; his reaction to the broker having forwarded all the<i>other</i>stuff beyond the resume would have spoken volumes about his true character.</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

Well, Shaun can rest easy: he's not alone.</p><p>Apparently, PHP can't handle dates either.</p><p>Whether you're Shaun or<strong>Chris M</strong>, working for an email-marketing company whose clients needed some tweaks to their software integration, inheriting a codebase is always the same: like inheriting a teetering cliffside mansion from your eccentric grand-uncle, the hair on the nape of your neck seems to tickle as you reach for the doorknob. Something primordial reaching up into your consciousness, warning you. But you always go in, despite the horror doubtlessly lurking inside... Chris had just finished recovering from exposure to a custom, PHP-delimited file importer when he received his new inheritance from a fellow consultant. Among the first things Chris learned from inspecing the code was that, if you abuse a database long enough, you can force it to reveal the next 31 days.</p><p>First, insert dates into a database table:</p><pre><code>INSERT IGNORE INTO Dates (Dates) VALUES(DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL+1 DAY));;INSERT IGNORE INTO Dates (Dates) VALUES(DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL+2 DAY));;INSERT IGNORE INTO Dates (Dates) VALUES(DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL+3 DAY));;...&lt;snip&gt;...INSERT IGNORE INTO Dates (Dates) VALUES(DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL+32 DAY));;</code></pre><p>Then, select the next 31 days and their difference from the current date, so we can iterate over them back in PHP Land - a benighted, backwards place where not a single tool to manipulate a date has ever been even theorized.</p><pre><code>$sql=&lt;&lt;&lt;SQLSELECT Dates, DATEDIFF(Dates, CURDATE()) AS `datediff`FROM DatesWHERE DATEDIFF(Dates, CURDATE())&lt; 32 AND DATEDIFF(Dates, CURDATE())&gt; -1 ;SQL;$result = $db-&gt;query($sql);while ($row = $result-&gt;fetch()) {...&lt;snip&gt;...}</code></pre><p>His mind left fragile by its tango with the previous PHP perversion, Chris pulled a colleague in to make sure the above wasn't some sort of hallucination. The other developer offered that perhaps the code's author had understood SQL better than PHP. While Chris appreciated the effort, the thirty-two INSERTs into the same field in the same table made that justification seem unlikely. But it did make him feel better enough to replace the lot with this, leaving the poor database to nurse its wounds in peace:</p><pre><code>for ($i = 0; $i&lt;= 31; $i++) {$date = date('Y-m-d', strtotime(\"+$i days\"));...&lt;snip&gt;...}</code></pre><p>Remember, developers: before you reach for the Swiss Army knife of your nearest database, do poor Chris and Shaun a favour and consider that your programming language of choice just might be able to do things with dates all by itself.</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

It may be a common financial transaction, but from an IT standpoint, the problem of integrating these two systems is always unique, always cumbersome, and fraught with problems.<strong>Sajid</strong><!-- Since this story makes the workplace easily identifiable, we have changed the submitter's name. -->was one of the lucky individuals tasked with the great undertaking of moving these banks to<em>one</em>information system.</p><img src=\"http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/remy/war_of_wealth.jpg\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin: 8pt; float: right;\" /><p>Sajid’s business contact at the new acquisition was Karel. The latest round of requirements from Karel described a system to track the movement of trade data from his office, in the Netherlands, to Sajid’s, in London. The underlying business logic was simple, but the nature of financial data added layers of complexity. Moving data around was insufficient- there needed to be auditing, tracing, regulatory compliance.<!-- That's the joke -->The project needed a risk management plan, the tool itself needed a clearly documented backup and recovery plan, and on top of all of that there was the simple management overhead of doing anything in a large organization.</p><p>Sajid’s finished estimate for the project contained a large number of digits. Karel blanched at the expense, thanked Sajid for his time, and scurried back to Rotterdam. Sajid assumed that he’d receive a budget in a few days.</p><p>Instead, everything was silent for months. The original deadline for the migration project slipped past, and a new project called“Tail Migration” began. When that deadline became a historical relic, the“Post-Migration” began, and mutated into the“Post-Tail-Abaft-Ongoing-Terminal Migration”. The ever-changing nature of integrating two systems nobody understood kept Sajid busy.</p><p>Then £14M vanished. Someplace over the North Sea, the data ceased to exist. Given the number of integration packages which handled the records, and given how many of them Sajid was responsible for, the missing money became Sajid’s very large problem.</p><p>Sajid started by searching the mainframes for the transaction data. He moved over to the MQ logs, the BizTalk audit trails, and the couch cushions. All he could find was a fourteen-million-pound-shaped-hole in their records. Suggesting that it might be a rounding error, or a missed decimal point didn’t make his management happy.<!-- The same thing happened in Superman III --></p><p>Sajid called Karel.“Oh, yes,” Karel said.“We did have an issue with the<em>Bankieren Integratie Tool</em>. I had to delete the code and rebuild it. Perhaps some transactions were lost?”</p><p>“The<em>what</em>? Wait- wasn’t that the estimate request I did? We never built that for you.”</p><p>“Well, you wanted too much money. We only need the system until migration is complete. We found an outside contractor who worked more cheaply. I’ll send you a link to the network share on my computer.”</p><p>Sajid’s mouse-hand twitched with terror and rage. He opened the network share and saw what he feared he would see- 8GB of data split across 6 Access databases. It was clearly“backed up”: a sub-folder on the same share called“<span onclick=\"cornify_add();return false;\" title=\"click me!\">Reservekopie</span><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.cornify.com/js/cornify.js\"></script>” contained older versions of all the files.</p><!-- Microsoft Office is the most widely deployed development environment in the world. Every business user on Earth has a copy. If only 0.1% of them use it, there are more Office-related WTFs than there are IT workers in the world. --><p>Sajid poked at the files like they were made of pure nitroglycerine and might explode if he sneeze.<!-- This is probably true. -->Despite being a mass of VBA, clumsy SQL queries, and being mostly written in Dutch, Sajid still recognized some of the functionality that he had estimated months prior. Like an old hard candy, forgotten under the couch, it had gathered layers of dust, dirt, and garbage. New features and reports had been added. None of it was audited. None of it was tracked.</p><p>There were nearly a billion pounds worth of transactions sitting in that database. Sajid had no idea if any lived in some other system, or if this were their only record.</p><p>Sajid copied the application and picked apart the database like a coroner examining a murder victim. Most of the data resided in split files- Access capped at 2GB of data per file. All of the code resided in one file called“DeCode.accdb”. In addition to holding code, it held scratch tables for some of its work.</p><p>It was impossible to be certain, but Sajid’s best guess was that some bug in the underlying VBA code threw errors, and convinced Karel that the database was“corrupt”. Karel deleted“DeCode” and replaced it with his“backup”. The £14M Sajid needed to find caused the error, and had been deleted along with the scratch table.</p><p>The data was gone, and with it, the money. There was no IT solution here, and Sajid needed to turn this over to accounting. They needed to perform an audit to rebuild the transaction data. Banking regulators would need to get involved. Honestly afraid of the coming fallout, Sajid went to his boss to deliver the bad news.</p><p>Little did he know that his boss had bigger problems- the person responsible for running their close-of-business batch jobs had accidentially deleted the entire process queue. Their bank was effectively closed until the very finicky mainframe scheduling system could be reconfigured. Suddenly, losing £14M wasn’t much of a problem.<!-- This is the rare case where anyone with a modicum of Google-fu knows exactly what organization this represents. For the record, the submitter actually pointed out that losing these transactions was such a common occurance that their accounting team was quite adept at finding them again. --></p><p><small>Image via Wikimedia Commons.<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:War_of_wealth_bank_run_poster.jpg\">Source</a>.</small></p><!-- Easy Reader Version: They lost £14M.

It makes total sense.”</p><p>“You’re not running up against our non-compete?” Peter asked.</p><p>“No, man. We’re‘consultants’ now- totally different gig.” Bob turned back to add in a whisper,“and making<i>twice</i>the money! Lunch is on an expense account, by the way. Want to come to the steakhouse with us?”</p><p>Peter couldn’t fault Bob, especially not in the age when most employers discarded entire divisions like empty bottles of Evian. Still, in a way Peter felt like<i>he</i>was being left to sink or swim, not the company.</p><p>“Who came up with this idea?” he couldn’t help asking.“You or them?”</p><p>Bob sighed and looked down at Peter, in more senses than one.“Look, it’s not important. Hang in there, man. Maybe one of these days, you’ll get to do the same thing.”</p><p>Instead of developing in-house— too expensive— Peter’s company had contracted ConsultPro to implement a SharePoint core to unify dozens of their business applications. The project had lasted over a year, long enough for facades to melt away. The “strategic partnership” morphed from a collaboration of equals to a nimble parasite feeding off a dim- and slow-witted host. Not only was ConsultPro raking in monstrous hourly fees for its “specialized expertise,” it was also poaching three of the company’s engineers.</p><p>Peter wasn’t bitter. His chief responsibility lay in network account administration, so it wasn’t surprising that ConsultPro hadn’t come at him with the magical Wand of Consultant. However, there would be lots of knowledge transfer and shared responsibility until replacements arrived, cutting into all the work the department already had to do. Peter was also backup support for ConsultPro’s new solution, and had to familiarize himself with its underpinnings. He read up on documentation, played in the test environment, and handled the smaller tasks that primary support didn’t have time for. Meanwhile, Bob and his cohorts ascended to the land where money hemorrhaged upon those who dressed the most basic observations in the fanciest terms amid the swankest soirees.</p><p>The new system had some minor hiccups, as new systems do. It went live, and users acclimated. All went well for several months. Management toasted themselves for hiring outside help and reducing the Engineering budget, freeing up company resources to better focus on core strategies— like management bonuses. Perhaps the company didn’t need so many developers and support reps after all—</p><p>—and then, a major crash paralyzed everything. No one could log into the SharePoint portal. Thousands of users lost access to the apps they needed to do business. Peter’s CEO placed a frantic call to ConsultPro. Within an hour, Bob and the other two poached engineers returned to their former workplace and secreted themselves away in the biggest conference room on Peter’s floor.</p><p>Peter wasn’t primarily responsible, but decided to drop in on Bob and his old coworkers.“Hey! How’s it going?”</p><p>“Hi.” None of them managed more than that. A tension normally reserved for bomb disarmament choked the air out of the room.</p><p>“Um…” Peter grasped for something to say.“Anything I can help with?”</p><p>Bob ran a hand over his thinning hair, sighing and muttering.“It’s been two hours and we haven’t figured this out. You better clear out of here. It’s really complex, we’d probably bore you.”</p><p>Peter peered over Bob’s shoulder, at the error message on his laptop.“It could be that the security log’s full. Have you checked the application’s internal registry?”</p><p>The consultants in the room glanced up with a shot, questioning looks on their faces.</p><p>Peter walked Bob to the proper registry key.“This should be a 1, not a 4. It does that when the security log is full and has failed to be cleared and saved properly. Run the script<code>save-and-empty-seclog</code>, that should take care of it.”</p><p>Stunned, Bob nevertheless complied. Within minutes, everything was up and running again.</p><p>“How did you know that?” one of the other consultants asked, astonished.</p><p>“It’s in the documentation,” Peter said.“The same documentation<i>you</i>released to<i>us</i>. So this is why you get twice the pay I get?”</p><p>Peter shrugged, and left before any of them replied.</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

When the owner, an old man named Brad, had offered her a position after spotting her in a student computer lab, she thought he was crazy, but a background check confirmed everything he said. Now she wondered if her first intuition was correct.</p><p>“Anita, welcome!” Brad seemed to bounce like a toddler as he showed Anita inside. The walls of the converted garage were bare drywall; the wall-mounted AC unit rattled and spat in the corner. In three corners of the office sat discount computer desks. Walls partitioned off Brad’s office in the fourth corner.</p><p>He practically shoved Anita into an unoccupied desk. The computer seemed to be running an unlicensed version of Windows 8, with no Office applications of any kind. “Ross can fill you in!” He left the office, slamming the door shut behind him.</p><p>“Hi.” Ross rolled in his chair from his desk to Anita’s. “Brad’s a little enthusiastic sometimes.”</p><p>“I noticed. Uh, he never told me what game we’re working on, or what platform. Not even a title.”</p><p>Ross’s voice lowered to a whisper. “None of us know, either. We’ve been coding in Unity for now. He hired you as a programmer, right? Well, right now we just need someone to manage our documentation. I suggest you prepare yourself.”</p><p>Ross led Anita into Brad’s office. Above a cluttered desk hung a sagging whiteboard. Every square inch was covered by one, sometimes several, overlapping sticky notes. Each had a word or two written in Brad’s scrawl.</p><p>“We need more than just random post-its with ‘big guns!’ and ‘more action!’” Ross said. “We don’t even know what the title is! We’re going crazy without some kind of direction.”</p><p>Anita stared at the wall of sticky notes, feeling her sanity slipping from her mind like a wet noodle. “I’ll try.”</p><h3>Sticky Escalation</h3><blockquote><pre>Brad, can we switch to Word for our documentation? It’s getting harderto read your handwriting, and there’s a lot of post-its that havenothing to do with the game. This will make it easier to proceed withdevelopment. -Anita</pre></blockquote><p>Two minutes after she sent the email, Brad barged out of his office. “Anita, why spend thousands of dollars on software licenses when this works just fine? If you can’t do your job with the tools you have, what kind of a programmer does that make you?”</p><p>“Brad, this isn’t going to work forever. Your whiteboard is almost out of room, and you won’t take down any of your non-game stickies!”</p><p>“I can’t take any of them down, Anita! Any of them!” He slammed the door to his office behind him.</p><p>The next day, Anita was greeted at the door by the enthusiastic Brad she had met before the interview. “I listened to reason, Anita. I hope this is enough for you to finish this documentation and get coding again!”</p><p>Brad led Anita into his office. On every wall surface, over the door, even covering part of the floor, were whiteboards. Sticky notes dotted nearly a third of the new whiteboard space.</p><p>“Now, Anita, if I don’t see new code from you soon, I may just have to let you go! Now get to work!”</p><p>Anita went to sit at her desk, then stopped. Instead, she grabbed a bright red sticky note, wrote the words “I QUIT” with a sharpy, barged into Brad’s office, and stuck it to his monitor. Brad was too stunned to talk as she left the converted garage.</p><h3>The Avalanche</h3><p>“Are you doing better?” Jason called Anita a few weeks later. Their short time together at GES has made them comrades-in-arms, and networking was crucial in the business.</p><p>“Much,” she said. “I got a real job with an indie developer in Santa Monica. We even have a wiki for our framework!”</p><p>“Well, listen to this. The day after you quit, the AC unit in the garage broke. I came into work to see Brad crying in a corner in his office. All of the sticky notes had curled in the humidity and fallen to the floor. The day after he got us all copies of Word.</p><p>“Too bad we still don’t know what the title of the game is.”</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

On the one hand, it helps make things faster. On the other, it can become a crutch, or worse, an excuse. Furthermore, caches can deceive us in two ways. First, they can easily hide a system's true performance characteristics, masking poor design until things start to fail. Secondly, while a cache might exposes a simple interface, getting the most of it requires that you pay close attention to details and have a thorough understand of how your system works.</p><h3>Defining a Cache</h3><p>To me, what defines something as a cache is the possibility of a miss. If you write code assuming that data is in the cache, then it isn't a cache, it's a database. The most tragic abuse of this I've seen are applications that won't even start unless they can connect to the cache.</p><p>We can rephrase this by defining what a cache isn't. A cache is not the reason your system can handle its current load. If you unplug your cache and system resources become exhausted, it isn't a cache. A cache isn't how you make your site fast, or handle concurrency. All it does is help.</p><p>Of course, that's a generalization. In fact, the goal of this post is to help you take a small step away from this generalization; to help you use caching as a integral part of a good design instead of just a bandaid.</p><h3>Stats Or It Didn't Happen</h3><p>To get the most out of a cache, you need to collect statistics. If you can't answer the question \"What's your cache hit ratio?\", you aren't caching, you're guessing. But a cache hit ratio is just the start of what you need to know.</p><p>For the rest of this post, I'm going to assume that you're using a cache to store a variety of objects with different characteristics. I'm talking about things like object size, cache duration, cost of a miss and so on.</p><p>When we look at our cache, there are 4 high-level statistics that we want to track, per object type:</p><ul><li>cache hit ratio,</li><li>number of gets,</li><li>cost of a miss, and</li><li>size of the data</li></ul><p>All of these help paint a clear picture of the health and effectiveness of your cache.</p><p>Since our cache sits as a proxy on top of a RESTful API, we can use the URL to figure out the object type. For example<code>/users/50u.json</code>and<code>/videos/99v/recommendations</code>map to the<code>show user</code>and<code>list video recommnedation</code>object types. Normally you should be able to use the object's cache key to figure out its type.</p><p>We collect our statistics via a custom nginx log format. Something like:</p><pre data-language=text># defined in the http section# our caching proxy sets the X-Cache header to hit or misslog_format cache '$request_method $uri $sent_http_x_cache $bytes_sent $upstream_response_time';....# defined in the specific location that proxies to our cacheaccess_log /var/log/apiproxy/cache.log cache buffer=128K;</pre><p>This gives us a file that looks like:</p><pre data-language=text>GET /v4/videos/75028v.json hit 2384 0.000GET /v4/videos/176660v.json miss 2287 0.002GET /v4/episodes.json hit 372 0.001GET /v4/videos/222741v/timed_comments/en.json hit 36747 0.001GET /v4/roles.json miss 511 0.012GET /v4/containers/20186c.json hit 1561 0.000GET /v4/containers/20186c/episodes.json miss 426 0.002GET /v4/containers/20186c/people.json miss 425 0.09GET /v4/containers/20186c/recommendations.json miss 5376 0.002GET /v4/containers/6784c/covers/en.json hit 9653 0.001GET /v4/containers/20186c/contributions.json miss 441 0.016GET /v4/users/51351u/subscriptions.json hit 360 0.001</pre><p>We don't need a huge amount of data. Just enough to get a good representation.<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/karlseguin/6079737\">It doesn't take much to parse this</a>. Here's a snapshot of the first time we analyzed our cache:</p><pre data-language=text>route                       |  total hits  |  ratio  |  size  |  miss time  |show videos                 |    758112    |  42.4   |  2114  |      4      |list videos/recommendations |    406792    |  38     |  4529  |      6      |show containers             |    393084    |  53.1   |  4577  |      4      |show sessions               |    390095    |  72.9   |   988  |     11      |show videos/subtitles       |    288032    |  89.6   | 19233  |     20      |list containers/people      |    266975    |  91.1   |  1232  |     17      |list videos/streams         |    228886    |  18.9   |   716  |      5      |show users                  |    221952    |  0      |   997  |     11      |</pre><p>Pretty horrible, eh? Our global cache hit ratio, hovering around a not-great 50%, wasn't very accurate. As an average, the routes with a good hit ratio masked just how bad things really were (not the mention the fact that something was obviously broken with the user's endpoint).</p><p>From the above, there's 1 core statistic that we aren't measuring: reason for evictions. Specifically, it would be helpful to know if items are being evicted because they are stale, or because the system is under pressure. Our solution for now, which is far from ideal due to the lack of granularity, is to measure the number of times we need to prune our cache due to memory pressure. Since we aren't currently under memory pressure (more on why later), we aren't seeing many prunes, and thus haven't looked very deeply into it.<p>If your cache isn't a proxy sitting near the top of your stack, you'll likely have to jump through more hoops to extract this data. You could also opt to log some or all of it in real-time using Statsd (or something similar). Finally, although it's always better to measure than assume, there's a good chance that you'll already have an idea about the size and load time of these objects relative to each other (still, measure and expect and be delighted at surprises!).</p><h3>Master Your Keys</h3><p>Few of our objects use a simple cache key, such as<code>video:4349v</code>. At best, some types have a handful of permutations. At worse, thousands. Many of our objects vary based on the user's country, platform (web, mobile, tv, ...), user's role and query string parameters (to name a few). This is the reason we had to move beyond Varnish: we needed to generate cache keys that were application-aware. Many object types, for example, treat our iOS and Android applications as the same platform, but a few don't.</p><p>This ends up being application specific. The important thing to know is that there'll come a point where a single cache key format just won't scale (because you'll have to pick the one with the most permutations for all routes). It might seem like you're violating some type of design rule, but coupling your keys to your data and system behavior becomes critical if you want to keep things under control.</p><p>I will say that we did spend some time normalizing our cache keys. For example, a<code>page=1</code>is the same as no<code>page</code>parameter, and a<code>per_page=10</code>is the same no<code>per_page</code>parameter. It's trivial to do and it can cover some rather common cases (these two are particularly good example of common cases).</p><p>Speaking of paging, early on, we had the capability to serve small<code>per_page</code>request from a larger one. For example, if we had a<code>per_page=25</code>cached, we'd be able to server any requests where<code>per_page</code>was&lt;= 25. We'd actually over-fetch and overlap pages to minimize the impact of various paging inputs. Ultimately this proved incompatible with other design goals, but it's a decent example of how your cache keys don't have to be dumb.</p><p>Key permutations is one of those things that can easily cause your caching to fall apart. It's pretty easy to miss the impact on your cache that new features will have. A seemingly isolated feature might force you to add new permutations across the system (we're currently facing this), which can easily cause a cascade. It isn't just that more permutations lead to more misses, but also that more variation ->more memory usage ->more evictions ->more misses.</p><p>Dump and examine your cache keys. Looks for patterns and duplications. Most importantly, make sure you're using the most granular key possible.</p><h3>Own Your Values</h3><p>We've taken two steps to minimize the size of our cache, thus minimizing the number of misses due to premature eviction. The first and simplest is to store compressed values. As a proxy cache, this makes a lot of sense since decompression is distributed to clients. For an internal application cache, you'll likely get much less value from it. We use Nginx's relatively new gunzip module to take care of decompressing the content should the client not support compression.</p><p>The other feature that we've recently added is deduplication. The number of possible values is far smaller than the total number of possible keys. For example, even though we need to query them separately, a Canadian user is likely to get the same video details as an American user. This was one of the many projects our<a href=http://twitter.com/lvtien93>amazing intern</a>accomplished. The first thing he did was analyze the cache for duplicates. At 45% duplication after only a day's worth of uptime, we felt the feature was worth adding.</p><h3>Freshness</h3><p>Despite everything we've talked about so far, ultimately the best way to improve the effectiveness of your cache is to increase the duration items can stay in the cache. The downside to this is that users will get stale data.</p><p>I'm aware of two solutions to this problem. The first is to use object versions to bust the cache.<a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3112-how-basecamp-next-got-to-be-so-damn-fast-without-using-much-client-side-ui\">37signals has a good explanation of this approach</a>.</p><p>The approach that we're using is to purge the cache whenever there's an update. This worked well for us because we were already using a queue to communicate changes between system (as a side note, I strongly recommend that you do this, you'll end up using it more than you can imagine). So it was really just a matter of creating a new listener and sending an HTTP purge to each data center. Most items are purged within 2 seconds of an update.</p><p>This approach did require that we design our cache so that we could purge an object, say video 10 and purge all variations (json, xml, country us, country ca, ....). If you're using Varnish, it already supports purging all variations.</p><h3>But Wait, There's More</h3><p>Varnish has two neat features that we adopted into our own cache which can be quite useful: grace mode and saint mode. Grace mode is about serving up a slightly stale value while a fresh value is fetched in the background. This solves two problems. First, everyone gets a fast cache response. Secondly, when a lot of people ask for the same object at the same time (called a thundering herd), only a single fetch is made.</p><p>Saint mode is about serving up stale values when a fresh value isn't available.</p><p>Here's what the flow looks like:</p><pre data-language=go>cached, is_cached := cache.Get(key)if is_cached {if c.Fresh() {return cached}// it's ok to serve something that's aged, but not staleif cached.Aged() {go grace(req)return cached}}//not cachedresponse := getResponse(req)//we got an error, might as well serve the cached object//no matter its ageif response.Status()>= 500&& is_cached {return cached}</pre><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Caching isn't a trivial problem to solve. For us, the solution was to collect data and increase our coupling between the cache and the rest of the systems. We've introduced some cases where changes to the business logic will need to be reflected in the cache. We also spent time removing a lot of inefficiency that come from trying to use it as a generic get/set mechanism. Deduplication was a huge win, which for the time being has resolved our memory constraint. Cleaning up our keys is an ongoing effort as new features are introduced which add new permutations.</p><p>Today, our cache hit ratio is looking much better. Within the next couple days we hope to bring the top 10 resources up above 80% (we're almost there). The most important thing though is that all the systems which sit behind our caching layer can survive without it. Some considerably better than others, true. But we aren't driving our cache hit ratio up because our system won't work otherwise. We're driving it up because it results in a better user experience.</p>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":228}}

However, if there's one class of abstraction that stands out as being particularly offensive, it has to be string manipulation libraries. Like most things, it isn't the libraries themselves which are inefficient, but rather the way developers use and abuse them.</p><p>I assume, but am not sure, that when developers see a string, they visualize a character array. This is the critical way to think of strings since almost any operation happens linearly across the string, one character at a time. If you want to find the index of a space within a string, you start at the first character and compare each character one at a time until you find a match:</p><pre data-language=go>for i := 0; i&lt; len(haystack); i++ {if haystack[i] == needle { return i }}return -1</pre><p>On their own, built-in string functions are efficient. However, as building blocks for more advanced manipulation, they just won't cooperate properly. In other words, each operation tends to require its own.</p><p>For example, let's say that we're parsing a response from memcache and the presence of \"END\" was of great importance to us. Here's a real example:</p><pre data-language=javascript>if (buffer.indexOf('END') != -1) {first_line_len = buffer.indexOf(crlf) + crlf_len;var end_indicator_start = buffer.indexOf('END');....}</pre><p>The above code scans the string 3 times. The string might be tens of thousands of characters long and as code that's meant to parse memcache replies, I think it's reasonable for this code to focus on performance at the cost of readability:</p><pre data-language=javascript>var first_line_len = -1var end_indicator_start = -1for (var i = 0, length = buffer.length; i<length; ++i) {var c = buffer[i]if (c == '\\r') {if (first_line_len == -1&&buffer[i+1] == '\\n') {first_line_len = i + 2}} else if (c == 'E'&&buffer[i+1] == 'N'&&buffer[i+2] == 'D'&&end_indicator_start == -1) {end_indicator_start = i...}}</pre><p>A lot of string parsing can be done within a single scan, so long as you're willing to maintain state in local variables. Built-in functions can't help since the state is application specific. Yes, the above is much uglier, but that ugliness can be wrapped (note, not abstracted) into a meaningfully named function.</p><p>In addition to turning what ought to be an O(1) operation into an O(N), there's one particular string function which I often see horribly abused:<code>string.split</code>. Splitting a string, on a separator, only to extract a specific part is so lazy. For example:</p><pre data-language=ruby>File.readlines('logs.txt').each do |line|ip = line.strip.split(' ')[-1]...end</pre><p>This has got to be the mother of all inefficiencies. Not only is the above code scanning the entire string from left to right (even though we only want the end), but it's modifying the string (<code>strip</code>) and allocating, then discarding, an array. Splitting a string should only be used when you need multiple parts and those parts should never just be located at the start and/or end. The above is better written as:</p><pre data-language=ruby>File.readlines('logs.txt').each do |line|ip = line[line.rindex(' ')..-2]...end</pre><p>Even for medium sized inputs (either in terms of total lines, or line sizes), the performance difference is not trivial.</p><p>Of course it all comes down to the specific case and what you're willing to gain and give up. Readability and time to ship versus code efficiency. Code with high throughput or dealing with large data will have different operational requirement than some low traffic web controller. Still, it never hurts to be conscious about what's actually going on under the covers. With respect to strings, what's typically going on are N linear scans through the string and more often than not there is an O(1) solution available.</p>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":229}}

What makes slices so useful, besides the fact that<a href=\"http://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#SliceHeader\">they require very little overhead</a>, is that they can always be transparently substituted with an actual array:</p><pre data-language=go>a := []string{\"b\", \"a\", \"m\", \"i\", \"h\", \"n\", \"f\"}sort.Strings(a)//a is now equal to [\"a\", \"b\", \"f\", \"h\", \"i\", \"m\", \"n\"]b := []string{\"b\", \"a\", \"m\", \"i\", \"h\", \"n\", \"f\"}sort.Strings(b[2:4])//b is now equal to [\"b\", \"a\", \"i\", \"m\", \"h\", \"n\", \"f\"]</pre><p>But there's one important thing to remember about slices, especially if you're keeping them around for a long time: they hold a reference to the underlying array.<em>Well of course they do</em>, you're thinking,<em>they are little more than pointers to the an underlying array, so what?</em></p><h3>What Are You?</h3><p>The problem, if you'll be so generous to let me call it that, comes back to that issue of transparency. Slices are so transparent that it isn't always obvious whether you're dealing with a slice or an actual array. As an example, consider the signature of the popular<code>ioutil.Readall</code>function:</p><pre data-language=go>func ReadAll(r io.Reader) ([]byte, error)</pre><p>Does it return an array or a slice of an array? If it's a slice, it's memory footprint might be a lot more than<code>len</code>. To get the size of the underlying structure, you want to use<code>cap</code>. The realization that any function that returns an array might actually be far more wasteful than is immediately evident isn't pleasant (especially to newcomers).</p><h3>512 Bytes Of Pain</h3><p>But wait, there's more. A lot of code, in Go's own libraries, in third party libraries and probably in your own code, makes use of the<code>bytes.Buffer</code>structure - a<code>[]byte</code>-backed growing data structure.<code>ioutil.ReadAll</code>itself is a thin wrapper around a<code>bytes.Buffer</code>. And here's where I ran into an unexpected behavior.</p><p>The first piece of code is the idiomatic way to read an HTTP response in Go:</p><pre data-language=go>body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)</pre><p>If we know the size of the response, the above code is rather inefficient. The buffer starts at 512 bytes and uses 2x growth algorithm. The result is a number of unnecessary allocation and  high likelihood of wasted memory (again, this last part isn't immediately obviously until you compare the length of body with its capacity). The solution?:</p><pre data-language=go>buffer := bytes.NewBuffer(make([]byte, 0, resp.ContentLength)buffer.ReadFrom(res.Body)body := buffer.Bytes()</pre><p>Given a<code>ContentLength</code>of 70KB, what would you imagine<code>len(body)</code>and<code>cap(body)</code>to equal? The length will be the expected 70KB, but the capacity will be 143872 bytes. For a reason that isn't clear to me, the<code>bytes.Buffer</code>class requires<code>bytes.MinRead</code>extra space. It has a value of 512. So unless we create a buffer of<code>res.ContentLength + bytes.MinRead</code>, we'll end up with an array which is 70K*2 + 512 of actual space.</p><h3>A Memory Leak</h3><p>Look, what's a memory leak within the context of a runtime that provides garbage collection? Typically it's either a rooted object, or a reference from a rooted object, which you haven't considered. This is obviously different as it's really extra memory you might not be aware of. Rooting the object might very well be intentional, but you don't realize just how much memory it is you've rooted. Sure, my ignorance is at least 75% to blame. Yet I can't help but shake the feeling that there's something too subtle about all of this. Any code can return something that looks and quacks like an array of 2 integers yet takes gigs of memory. Furthermore,<code>bytes.MinRead</code>as a global variable is just bad design. I can't imagine how many people think they've allocated X when they've really allocated X*2+512.</p><h3>Solutions</h3><p>If you're dealing with short lived objects, none of this is going to be an issue. However, for long-lived objects, there are a couple simple solution. First and foremost, if you need to track how much memory's actually used (say you're building an LRU cache that keeps itself nice and trim) use<code>cap</code>instead of<code>len</code>. But that doesn't solve the problem of wasted space.</p><p>When you know the size of the data, like in the above case with a<code>ContentLength</code>, you should use the<code>io.ReadFull</code>:</p><pre data-language=go>body := make([]byte, 0, resp.ContentLength)_, err := io.ReadFull(res.Body, body)</pre><p>Otherwise, you'll have to first read it into a growing buffer and then copy it back into a fixed-length array. You'll need to decide if the saved memory is worth the extra CPU. We use something like:</p><pre data-language=go>//ioutil.ReadAll starts at a very small 512//it really should let you specify an initial sizebuffer := bytes.NewBuffer(make([]byte, 0, 65536))io.Copy(buffer, r.Body)temp := buffer.Bytes()length := len(temp)var body []byte//are we wasting more than 10% space?if cap(temp)>(length + length / 10) {body = make([]byte, length)copy(body, temp)} else {body = temp}</pre><p>My fog of ignorance has been slightly reduced.</p>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":230}}

Things like dynamic arrays (aka [Array]Lists) and StringBuilder. They are a useful convinience that comes with a steep price: poor memory characteristics.</p><p>The way these work is simple: a fixed-length structure (typically an array) which copies itself into a larger fixed-length structure as needed. A dynamic array, for example, might start life as a fixed-array capable of holding 20 items. Inserting a 21st item causes a new array, with a capacity of 40 to get allocated. The values within the old array are copied to the new array along with the new item, thus leaving 19 free slots.</p><p>The performance characterstics of such structures is the same as the underlying structure for read operations. While a write operation isn't guarnateed to be the same as the underlying structure, more often than not, it is.</p><p>The real problem with these structures is the impact they have on memory. Consider Go's useful<code>ioutil.ReadAll</code>which uses a dynamically growing<code>bytes.Buffer</code>to read data from various sources into a byte array. It starts off with a an array of 512 bytes and grows by 2 as needed. To read a 1 megabyte file, we'll need to allocate 11 distinct byte arrays. All but the last of these will serve any real purpose (the rest will eventually get garbage collected).</p><p>Things get much worse from here. First, buffers have a tendency to fragment memory. Those 10 extraneous allocations turn our heap into swiss cheese. There's 1 meg of free space, but it isn't continous, and thus not necessarily usable. Now our GC needs to do compaction. If memory is pinned, which happens when managed languages interop with unmaged code (at least in .NET, but I assume others as well), compaction suddenly becomes difficult. Before long, you're running out of memory despite only using a fraction of what appears to be available.</p><p>But wait, there's more. What happens if we want to read a file that's a few bytes more than 1MB? We'll need to make a 12th allocation, which will consume 2MB. That's almost 50% wasted space.</p><p>What can we do? First, if you know the size upfront, don't use a dynamic structure. Here's how you can read a file in Go without the use of a dynamic buffer:</p><pre data-language=go>file, err := os.Open(\"itsover.9000\")if err != nil { ..handle .. }defer.file.Close()stat, _ := f.Stat()bytes := make([]byte, stat.Size())f.Read(bytes)</pre><p>If you don't know the exact size but have a vague idea, start there. Many buffer-based data structures let you specify an initial size, which is good because they tend to start small. Java's<code>StringBuilder</code>has a constructor which takes an initial<code>capacity</code>. Use it.</p><p>As a more advanced, but certainly not uncommon approach, many people use a pool to avoid having to dynamically allocate memory. In the above Go example, rather than creating a byte array on the fly, I could possibly checkout a slice from a much larger pool which is initialized on startup. Once done with the byte array, I'd release it back into the pool. This essentially eliminates fragementation and any GC impact, since the memory will never be GC'd. It's a more advanced topic, but certainly worth considering in some cases (like reading and writing a lot and to sockets).</p><p>The important thing though is that you understand how these dynamic structures work, and the impact they have on memory. Understand that they tend to start small and grow as needed (2x isn't a rule, but it's common and a safe way to think about it). Each time it grows, a hole is left in your memory which will need to be garbage collected.</p><p>If your objects are long lived, consider that you might be holding on to a lot more memory than you realize.

Consider an address book -there's a host of things that you might want to add. With new socialnetworks popping up every day, users might want to add a new fieldfor a Bunglr id to their contacts.</p><p>For in-memory purposes, often the best way to do this is to allowclasses to include a hashmap field for user-defined fields (apattern Kent Beck calls<i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013476904X?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=013476904X\">Variable State</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321601912\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"/></i>).</p><pre># rubyclass Contactattr_accessor :firstname, :lastnamedef initialize@data = {}enddef [] argreturn @data[arg]enddef []= key, value@data[key] = valueendendaCustomer = Contact.newaCustomer.firstname = \"Martin\"aCustomer[:bunglrId] = 'fowl'</pre><p>With a setup like this you can add affordances to your UI toallow users to attach new fields to objects. If you want common userdefined fields, you can use a class variable to keep a list ofcommon keys for the hashmap. There is some awkwardness in thatregular fields are accessed differently to user-defined fields, butdepending on your language even this can be overcome. If yourlanguage supports<a href=\"/dslCatalog/dynamicReception.html\">Dynamic Reception</a>then youuse this to access the hashmap with regular field access.</p><pre>class Contact...def method_missing(meth, *args)if @data.has_key? methreturn @data[meth]elsesuperendend</pre><p>Often the trickiest part of this is figuring out how to persistthis. If you're using a schemaless database, then it's usuallystraightforward - you just add the user-defined keys to yourapplication defined ones. The trickiness comes from a database witha<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/schemaless/\">storage schema</a>, particularly a relational database.</p><p>Usually the best option is to use a<a href=\"/eaaCatalog/serializedLOB.html\"><b>Serialized LOB</b></a>,essentially creating a large text column into which you store theuser-defined fields as a JSON or XML document. Many databases thesedays offer pretty nice support for this approach, including supportfor indexing and querying based on the data structure within theLOB. However such support, if available, is usually more awkwardthan using fields.<a href=\"#footnote-index\">[1]</a></p><p>Another route is using some kind of<b>attribute table</b>. A tablemight look something like this.</p><pre>CREATE TABLE ContactAttributes (contactId   INTEGER,attribute   TEXT,value       TEXT,PRIMARY KEY (contactId, attribute))</pre><p>Again, querying and indexing are awkward. Queries can involve agood bit of extra joins that can get rather messy.</p><p><b>Pre-defined custom fields</b>offer another system. Here you set theschema up with fields like<code>custom_field_1</code>(and perhaps<code>custom_field_1_name</code>. You are limited to only the numberof custom fields per instance that you have pre-defined. As usualindexing and querying are awkward.</p><p>When using a attribute table or pre-defined custom fields you maychoose to have different columns for different SQL data types. Sopre-defined fields might be<code>integer_1, integer_2,text_1…</code>, or a attribute table might have multiple valuefields (<code>text_value, integer_value</code>).</p><p>A<b>dynamic schema</b>is an approach that's often overlooked.To do this you set things up so that when someone adds a field, youuse an<code>alter table</code>statement to add that field to thetable. Our<a href=\"http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/mingle-agile-project-management\">Mingle team</a>does this and have beenhappy with how it's worked out.<a href=\"#footnote-mingle\">[2]</a>The new fields can be indexed andqueried just the same as application-defined fields. This does meanall instances get all fields, so is less handy if you get a lot ofvariance between instances.</p><p>Your persistance scheme choices will be affected by what you usefor relational mapping. User-defined fields aren't the mostwell-trod parts of the relational mapping problem, so there's a lotof variation in support from different relational mapping libraries.</p><p>User-defined fields are a similar problem to non-uniform types<a href=\"#footnote-non-uniform\">[3]</a>.Both problems lead to the need for a more flexible schema, or indeeda truly schemaless approach (although remember that<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/schemaless/\">schemaless doesn'tmean you don't have a schema</a>). If you have non-uniform typesthat aren't changing at the users' behest, then one of theinheritance oriented patterns may make sense.

Paul explains how Puppet, Chef and CFEngine relate.</li><li>(04:07) K Scott asks if it’s worthwhile to look at Puppet in a small environment with 2-3 servers. Paul says there’s an investment, so you really start seeing the rewards as things start getting more complex.</li><li>(05:01) K Scott asks how you define a state.</li><li>(06:30) K Scott asks about the client running on the target servers.</li><li>(06:51) Jon asks how the verification works.</li><li>(07:32) Jon asks if it’s possible to use Puppet in cloud environments.</li><li>(07:56) K Scot asks if you can use Puppet to configure developer workstations.

Paul talks about the PowerShell scripts they exec from Puppet and how they use them to do things like turn Windows features on and off.</li><li>(11:01) K Scott asks if you could use Chocolatey with Puppet, and Paul says they’re using Chocolatey via PowerShell. Jon says that sounds useful since Chocolatey can now integrate with the Web Platform Installer, and Paul says they’re doing just that to install .NET 4 on their servers.</li></ul><li>More questions about Puppet</li><ul><li>(11:47) Paul talks about how traditional infrastructure management runs on documentation, and how they can replace all of that using Puppet.</li><li>(12:58) K Scott asks if this is also useful for deployments. Paul says a deployment is just a different configuration state, so Puppet can handle that just fine.</li><li>(14:09) Jon asks if Puppet can handle database state.</li><li>(14:50) Jon asks how you handle licenses with Puppets.</li><li>(15:20) Jon asks how Puppet relates to Windows configuration management options.

Laurent lists a few of the cases where people ask for HTML based work, but says the cases are very rare. Generally they’re much more productive with XAML and C#. </li><li>(02:49) Rob asks Laurent if he thinks this will change over time. Laurent says IDE support may affect things a little, but generally he thinks web developers don’t do desktop development because they don’t want to do desktop development – they went into web development because they wanted to develop for the web. </li><li>(04:09) Jon asks if Laurent sees things changing over time in XAML based development. Laurent says he sees some big changes in performance – you can get good performance out of the native controls with full designer support now. In terms of Windows 8, he’s hoping for more controls to cover some Windows 8 UI elements so they don’t require custom controls. In terms of design, he sees some cases where people are breaking some of the general Windows Store design guidelines in cases where they aren’t as user friendly. Jon says he’s seen one example of this – adding a print app bar button to applications where printing is a regular activity, even though technically the print is supposed to be accessed via the share charm. Laurent says he also sees this in search-heavy apps. </li></ul></li><li>Cross-platform code sharing and Portable Class Libraries<ul><li>(07:46) Jon asks about Laurent’s talk on sharing code between platforms – does it work? Laurent says he’s focusing on portable class libraries – writing logic that works on Windows Phone and Windows Store, then building a UI on top of those libraries. That’s working well for him and he’s using it in production. It’s still XAML and C#, so you can also share code, too. </li><li>(09:26) K Scott asks about MVVM Light – is that working with Portable Class Libraries? Laurent says someone at Microsoft use a PCL port of MVVM Light as a test case, and it’s working very well. They still maintain platform specific versions of MVVM Light for people who only work on a specific platform. </li><li>(10:38) K Scott asks for a quick summary of what MVVM Light does. </li><li>(12:45) K Scott asks about some of the challenges in converting MVVM Light to a PCL. Laurent talks about some UI and platform differences. </li></ul></li><li>Metro and modern design<ul><li>(14:21) Rob asks how you make different design decisions around \"Metro\" design or other alternatives. Laurent discusses the design process. </li><li>(16:29) Rob asks about some of the design considerations, and how you’d decide on platforms. Laurent says a default XAML application uses themes which will fit in with the host platform and operating systems, but might look at bit boring, which is why you work with a designer. </li><li>(18:25) Jon says the Windows Store design principles don’t prescribe a boring look, referencing the \"alive with color\" thing and Kelly Sommers’ post about how Metro Doesn’t Have To Be Boring. Laurent says he doesn’t like the \"flat design\" term, preferring modern – and modern came from Bauhaus in the 1920′s, Swiss design in the 1950′s, etc. He says it’s important to go the design principles, then use your skill as a designer to apply that. There are enough apps on the Windows Phone store that getting noticed takes a good design. </li></ul></li><li>Hobbies<ul><li>(22:09) Rob asks Laurent what he does for hobbies. Laurent lists some things that keep him busy, then talks about his fish pond. Rob tells probably the worst newt joke of all time. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Show Links:</p><ul><li>Laruent Bugnion (<a href=\"http://galasoft.ch/\">http://galasoft.ch</a>, <a title=\"https://twitter.com/nikmd23\" href=\"https://twitter.com/lbugnion\">@lbugnion</a>) </li><li>NDC Session video: <a href=\"http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-8158\">Sharing code with MVVM Light in Windows and and Windows Phone</a>  </li><li><a href=\"http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/\">MVVM Light Toolkit</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windows/apps/hh781237\">Microsoft Design Principles</a> </li><li>Kelly Sommers: <a href=\"http://kellabyte.com/2011/12/19/when-metro-design-falls-off-the-tracks/\">When Metro Design Falls Off The Tracks</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://herdingcode.com/episode-26-laurent-bugnion-on-wpf-and-silverlight/\">Herding Code 26: Laurent Bugnion on WPF and Silverlight</a> </li></ul><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HerdingCode/~4/-8ZmQXoTsuo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?a=dsI2OgCAbII:-qDxWG98UWQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?a=dsI2OgCAbII:-qDxWG98UWQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?i=dsI2OgCAbII:-qDxWG98UWQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?a=dsI2OgCAbII:-qDxWG98UWQ:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?i=dsI2OgCAbII:-qDxWG98UWQ:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?a=dsI2OgCAbII:-qDxWG98UWQ:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?a=dsI2OgCAbII:-qDxWG98UWQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?i=dsI2OgCAbII:-qDxWG98UWQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"Scott Koon","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":276}}

Jon says he saw some parallels between things like food sanitation and source control – you need to start with fundamentals, but then you can apply them in creative ways. Nik describes some further parallels: cooking math and resourcing, the kitchen brigade system and project management. </li><li>(15:12) Nik talks about the ALT.NET of cooking and the focus on basic, classic skills. </li></ul></li><li>What’s next<ul><li>(16:08) K Scott asks Nik about what’s next for him.

Magnus discusses both pricing and policy changes for MDSN subscriptions. </li><li>(05:47) Jon asks what some of Magnus’ demos include. Magnus talks about using your own TFS service, other git repos, etc. He talks about a his secret demo – the non-Microsoft demo that uses TeamCity, NUnit, and GitHub. </li><li>(07:45) K Scott mentions all the new Azure SDK language support. </li></ul></li><li>Migrating to the cloud and surprise business transformations<ul><li>(07:54) Jon asks how this relates to Magnus’ work. Magnus works at Active Solution, which employs both of Sweden’s Azure MVP’s. Cloud development is really a hot field in Sweden right now. </li><li>(08:45) Jon asks about some common challenges. Magnus says the biggest thing is learning the platforms – there are a lot of architectural and strategic things they haven’t even considered. </li><li>(10:23) K Scott asks if businesses think they can’t move to the cloud because they have custom processes or protocols. </li><li>(10:59) Jon asks if they often do hybrid solutions.

Magnus tells the story of how they started talking to a few MVPs and things spiraled out of control. In the end they had all timezones, 92 locations, over 5000 attendees. They had some big turnout in some unexpected locations: Nepal, Brazil, Africa. </li><li>14:08 Jon asks what happened at the event. Magnus talks about the content in the Windows Azure Training Kit and a shared demo with nearly 5000 coordinated worker roles in a giant render farm passed the rendering power of some Pixar films. </li><li>(16:13) Jon asks about the relationship with Microsoft for the event. It was community run, but Microsoft helped out with things like attendee giveaways. </li><li>(16:52) Jon asks if they’ll do this again. Magnus says yes and talks about some of the scaling challenges. He calls out the sponsors, who gave away $18 million in license giveaways. It scales because each location is independent, so each location just needs to run one event.  </li><li>(18:36) Jon says this reminds him of Corey Haines’ Global Day of Code Retreat. </li><li>(18:52) Jon asks what Magnus is up to next. Magnus says he’s moving and calls out the upcoming CloudBurst conference – in Sweden and live streamed. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Show Links: </p><ul><li>Magnus Martensson (<a href=\"http://magnusmartensson.com/\">http:??magnusmartensson.com?</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/noopman\">@noopman</a>) </li><li>NDC Session video: <a href=\"http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-8167\">Continuous Delivery Zen on Windows Azure</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://activesolution.se/\">Active Solution</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://globalwindowsazure.azurewebsites.net/\">Global Windows Azure Bootcamp</a></li><li><a href=\"http://geekswithblogs.net/asmith/archive/2012/10/22/151043.aspx\">256 Worker Role 3D Rendering Demo is now a Lab on my Azure Course</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://globalday.coderetreat.org/\">Global Day of Coderetreat</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://www.azureug.se/CloudBurst2013\">CloudBurst 2013</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://herdingcode.com/herding-code-128-corey-haines-on-global-day-of-coderetreat-december-3/\">Herding Code 128 – Corey Haines on Global Day of Coderetreat</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://herdingcode.com/herding-code-143-paul-stack-on-continuous-delivery/\">Herding Code 143 – Paul Stack on Continuous Delivery</a> </li></ul><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/HerdingCode/~4/0U09AgKeUsw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?a=5Zed0Otkdyc:-8o28JnihMk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?a=5Zed0Otkdyc:-8o28JnihMk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?i=5Zed0Otkdyc:-8o28JnihMk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?a=5Zed0Otkdyc:-8o28JnihMk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?i=5Zed0Otkdyc:-8o28JnihMk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?a=5Zed0Otkdyc:-8o28JnihMk:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?a=5Zed0Otkdyc:-8o28JnihMk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Lazycoder?i=5Zed0Otkdyc:-8o28JnihMk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"Scott Koon","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":280}}

Nik talks about the importance of public communication. </li><li>(01:36) Jon mentions the difference between open source code and open source projects, and Nik mentions some of the different documented governance models for open source projects, citing OSS Watch and YUI. This helps </li><li>(03:15) K Scott asks if Glimpse presents unique challenges because there’s a plugin ecosystem. Nik says they used to just see code contributors and plugin authors, but now he sees contributors with a much broader perspective, citing Peter Hahndorf’s documentation contributions. </li><li>(4:54) Jon asks Nik how he defines success for an open source project. Nik says it depends on the project founder’s goals. He says project popularity isn’t important to him personally, it’s helping users. </li><li>(5:50) K Scott asks Nik about his slide that says Avoid Bikeshedding. Nik explains Parkinson’s law of triviality and how it affects open source. </li><li>(08:58) Jon asks Nik if he thinks roadmaps are important. Nik says this an important part of the public communication he mentioned earlier. Jon says he’s found that involving people in decisions that will affect them early really important for any kind of project, open source or not. Nik explains how this is handled in the meritocratic model. </li></ul></li><li>Cooking’s like programming<ul><li>(11:12) K Scott asks Nik about the latest big dish he’s prepared. </li><li>(12:45) Nik talks about the parallels between programming and cooking – both have rules that must be followed, but a lot of room for creativity. </li><li>(13:35) Jon talks about a professional chef textbook he got from the library (Nik tells him it’s from the Culinary Institute of America). Jon says he saw some parallels between things like food sanitation and source control – you need to start with fundamentals, but then you can apply them in creative ways. Nik describes some further parallels: cooking math and resourcing, the kitchen brigade system and project management. </li><li>(15:12) Nik talks about the ALT.NET of cooking and the focus on basic, classic skills. </li></ul></li><li>What’s next<ul><li>(16:08) K Scott asks Nik about what’s next for him. Nik talks about their latest release and the Heads Up Display. He talks about how simplified web publishing has led to a big increase in documentation contributions. K Scott raves about the UI design. </li><li>(18:45) Jon asks what’s new with semantic versioning since they last talked. </li><li>(19:18) Jon asks what’s next for Glimpse.

Puppet is a configuration management tool. It allows you to define a configuration management level, and Puppet will bring it to that level and keep it there.</li><li>(01:05) K Scott asks Paul how this relates to his continuous deployment emphasis. Paul explains how this has been part of the maturity model they’ve been using at his employer, Open Table.</li><li>(01:50) Paul explains how they started using Puppet in their pre-production environment of 19 VMs. Their production environment is four times that large.</li></ul><li>Some more questions about Puppet</li><ul><li>(03:00) Jon asks how Vagrant and Chef fit in. Paul explains how Puppet, Chef and CFEngine relate.</li><li>(04:07) K Scott asks if it’s worthwhile to look at Puppet in a small environment with 2-3 servers.

Paul talks about the PowerShell scripts they exec from Puppet and how they use them to do things like turn Windows features on and off.</li><li>(11:01) K Scott asks if you could use Chocolatey with Puppet, and Paul says they’re using Chocolatey via PowerShell. Jon says that sounds useful since Chocolatey can now integrate with the Web Platform Installer, and Paul says they’re doing just that to install .NET 4 on their servers.</li></ul><li>More questions about Puppet</li><ul><li>(11:47) Paul talks about how traditional infrastructure management runs on documentation, and how they can replace all of that using Puppet.</li><li>(12:58) K Scott asks if this is also useful for deployments.

Laurent lists a few of the cases where people ask for HTML based work, but says the cases are very rare. Generally they’re much more productive with XAML and C#. </li><li>(02:49) Rob asks Laurent if he thinks this will change over time. Laurent says IDE support may affect things a little, but generally he thinks web developers don’t do desktop development because they don’t want to do desktop development – they went into web development because they wanted to develop for the web. </li><li>(04:09) Jon asks if Laurent sees things changing over time in XAML based development. Laurent says he sees some big changes in performance – you can get good performance out of the native controls with full designer support now. In terms of Windows 8, he’s hoping for more controls to cover some Windows 8 UI elements so they don’t require custom controls. In terms of design, he sees some cases where people are breaking some of the general Windows Store design guidelines in cases where they aren’t as user friendly. Jon says he’s seen one example of this – adding a print app bar button to applications where printing is a regular activity, even though technically the print is supposed to be accessed via the share charm. Laurent says he also sees this in search-heavy apps. </li></ul></li><li>Cross-platform code sharing and Portable Class Libraries<ul><li>(07:46) Jon asks about Laurent’s talk on sharing code between platforms – does it work? Laurent says he’s focusing on portable class libraries – writing logic that works on Windows Phone and Windows Store, then building a UI on top of those libraries. That’s working well for him and he’s using it in production. It’s still XAML and C#, so you can also share code, too. </li><li>(09:26) K Scott asks about MVVM Light – is that working with Portable Class Libraries? Laurent says someone at Microsoft use a PCL port of MVVM Light as a test case, and it’s working very well. They still maintain platform specific versions of MVVM Light for people who only work on a specific platform. </li><li>(10:38) K Scott asks for a quick summary of what MVVM Light does. </li><li>(12:45) K Scott asks about some of the challenges in converting MVVM Light to a PCL. Laurent talks about some UI and platform differences. </li></ul></li><li>Metro and modern design<ul><li>(14:21) Rob asks how you make different design decisions around \"Metro\" design or other alternatives. Laurent discusses the design process. </li><li>(16:29) Rob asks about some of the design considerations, and how you’d decide on platforms. Laurent says a default XAML application uses themes which will fit in with the host platform and operating systems, but might look at bit boring, which is why you work with a designer. </li><li>(18:25) Jon says the Windows Store design principles don’t prescribe a boring look, referencing the \"alive with color\" thing and Kelly Sommers’ post about how Metro Doesn’t Have To Be Boring. Laurent says he doesn’t like the \"flat design\" term, preferring modern – and modern came from Bauhaus in the 1920′s, Swiss design in the 1950′s, etc. He says it’s important to go the design principles, then use your skill as a designer to apply that.

Plus an array of angry cockatoos, loud mouthed kookaburras and a pissed off koala (may have been a drop bear) keep things interesting for my new mates from Calcutta.

The proof used in these lines of reasoning are often speculations that could be possibilities but are in no way actually backed up by any evidence or truth. Specious reasoning can give great comic effect and is used often in television and movies to add levity to caricatures of conspiracy theorists and cast members that are meant to be viewed as ignorant or uneducated.</p></blockquote><p>That’s pretty much the argument of never having been hacked –<em>speculations that could be possibilities but are in no way actually backed up by any evidence or truth</em>. Let me give you another example related to<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/5-ways-to-implement-https-in.html\">my piece on Top CashBack</a>a few months ago. TechWeek Europe sought feedback from their technical director who stated:</p><blockquote><p>Mike Tomkins, technical director and one of the founders of TopCashback, said there had never been a breach of a customers’ bank account as a result of poor security on the site.</p></blockquote><p>Ok, I also read the bit about specious reasoning giving “great comic effect” but c’mon, this is just ridiculous! This was in response to my writing about numerous deficiencies in their HTTPS implementation after their Twitter account espoused the efficacy of some pretty mediocre practices. When insufficient HTTPS implementations are attacked it’s by a man<em>in the middle</em>or in other words, an attacker compromising the transport layer. That might mean the sniffing of wifi traffic or other similar attacks that are absolutely nowhere near the server itself. An attacker does not leave a helpful note somewhere after intercepting unprotected traffic – there are usually no obvious indicators of compromise.</p><p>Words such as Mike’s are nothing more than an attempt to build confidence without any basis of evidence whatsoever on which to do so. Of course he could have said “We are not aware of any previous breaches of customers’ bank account” but that doesn’t sound quite as convincing, does it?</p><p>The thing is, no matter how confident you are about your security position you cannot emphatically say that you haven’t had any breaches. Not convinced? Let’s look at a couple of examples that illustrate this.</p><h4>Advanced persistent threats</h4><p>Last week there was an article in Secure Computing Mag about<a href=\"http://www.scmagazine.com/hack-exposes-morningstar-data-on-182k-investors-including-some-credit-card-numbers/article/302318/\">182,000 accounts at investment research company Morningstar being compromised</a>. Unfortunate, but not uncommon. This statement, however, is rather interesting:</p><blockquote><p>An intrusion in April 2012 is thought to have compromised the Morningstar Document Research, formerly 10-K Wizard, which provides a global database and search tool to the company.</p></blockquote><p>What?! That’s 15 months ago and they only know about it<em>now?!</em>Had someone from Morningstar been asked about their security position during those 15 months in the same way Mike Tomkins from Top CashBack had been, how do you think they would have responded? Exactly.</p><p>Back on SC Mag again, in May they reported how<a href=\"http://www.scmagazine.com/hackers-may-have-had-access-to-resorts-credit-card-system-for-eight-months/article/295395/\">hackers may have had access to resort's credit card system for eight months</a>. This time it was Callaway Gardens and the resort unfortunately had some nasty Malware running for some time:</p><blockquote><p>According to a Callaway Gardens spokeswoman, the breach started in early September.</p></blockquote><p>Now keep in mind that this is<em>malware</em>– malicious software running on one or more compromised machines – the sort of stuff that’s often not overly difficult to detect (with some notable exceptions). Certainly it’s generally more overt than sniffed network traffic yet Callaway Gardens didn’t know it was there until well after the damage had already been done.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat\">Advanced persistent threats</a>(or APTs) are a well-established phenomenon and<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat\">Wikipedia summarises it nicely</a>:</p><p><img width=\"500\" height=\"496\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Diagram depicting the life cycle staged approach of an advanced persistent threat (APT) which repeats itself once complete\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-FaC-ItP1WM4/UeZd0QW8cJI/AAAAAAAAFg8/vpOHG4i_92c/Advanced_persistent_threat_lifecycle%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>They also refer to a recent report from<a href=\"http://intelreport.mandiant.com/\">Mandiant</a>exposing cyber espionage originating in China where they make the following findings with regards to APTs:</p><blockquote><p>In incidents analysed by Mandiant, the average period over which the attackers controlled victim's network was one year, with longest – almost five years</p></blockquote><p>That’s not too inconsistent with the previous SC Mag articles – about a year, give or take, before the victim actually realises what’s going on. If they ever do.</p><h4>Ignorance is bliss (at least until complacency gets you pwned)</h4><p>The attitudes described at the beginning of this post – the one about never having had security issues stemming from a risk then Mike’s from Top CashBack – are dangerously wrong. They breed complacency and demonstrate arrogance in the sense they imply that if these individuals are not aware of a breach then surely they could not have occurred. Specious reasoning indeed.</p><p>More than just ignorance to the basic mechanics of how website attacks often work though, these responses demonstrate a dangerous level of ongoing complacency. In the example from the opening paragraph of this post, the website in question stores plain text passwords in a cookie, doesn’t flag them as HttpOnly, has XSS flaws, emails passwords in plain text, locks out old credentials on password reset, emails a persistent short password of limited character set on reset, has mixed mode HTTPS flaws and sends the session ID over insecure connections. They know this and deem it acceptable. They hold personal data. They handle credit cards.</p><p>But don’t worry folks, they’ve not had a single security issue. To date…</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/bhpP1qyGjmM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":403}}

The Japanese have been making GT-Rs on and off for 44 years now but they really gained notoriety in the 90s as the top spec variants of their Skyline model. Down here where we only got a few of the machines on the local market, the Aussie press named it “Godzilla” for its monstrous performance ability and motorsport domination. The name kinda stuck around the world. It was so dominant in our local motorsport that it lead to the now infamous<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jOqmjSk0mI\">pack of arseholes speech</a>by our racing luminary Jim Richards after continued domination of a category that was usually the domain of rather mechanically basic front-engine, rear wheel drive V8s.</p><p>There was a 7 year GT-R hiatus from 2002 but come 2009 the car you see above arrived although this time it was built as a GT-R from the ground up and was no longer a hot version of the Skyline platform. From the outset, Nissan set a massively high performance bar clearly targeting Porsche’s 911 Turbo and spending a great whack of time on Germany’s<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring\">Nürburgring</a>(a long time benchmark for performance cars) and generally did a lot of chest-beating about<a href=\"http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_111189/title_Nissan-GTR-The-Supercar-for-Anyone-Anytime-Anywhere/newsarticle.html\">Anyone, Anytime, Anywhere</a>.</p><p>That’s enough of the history lesson, let’s get into the good bits! And yes, there is some video I’ve put together down the very end.</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Background</h4><p>Just a quick bit of context; the GT-R has replaced my much-loved, much “exercised” Subaru WRX STi:</p><p><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"STi at Wakefield\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ofdI_aFZQX0/UeRpBXCpvbI/AAAAAAAAFdc/I9LURjdCzjM/STi-At-Wakefield14.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"> <img width=\"267\" height=\"200\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"STi at Eastern Creek Skidpan\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/--KI6LGe2aHk/UeRpB70pJBI/AAAAAAAAFdk/WwiEM5DxJjM/166_7352230508_6316_n4.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"> <img width=\"267\" height=\"200\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"STi at Oran Park dirt motorkhana\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-hx5gwqJuECQ/UeRpCpkVyjI/AAAAAAAAFds/mduRcjO9jzg/166_7352220508_5863_n3.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Clearly it didn’t lead a gentle life! The STi was regularly used for club motorsport events, most often in “rally skills” events which were predominantly skidpans and dirt motorkhanas so it got a lot of<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXLREc9Nnv0&feature=c4-overview&playnext=1&list=TLcx18FZM1lX0\">this</a>. It was a great car, very well setup with just the right modifications for both road and track and took me to a club championship back in ‘07. It got some track time but I mostly got that out of my system with the previous WRX which saw<em>a heap</em>of competitive motorsport between 2000 and 2005 which meant a lot of<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW4U9Dwic2Q\">this</a>(class record that day too, thank you very much!)</p><p>So fast cars and active involvement in motorsport have been a passion for many years now and brought many fantastic experiences. In more recent years I’ve kept track time mostly to instructing duties (c’mon, who doesn’t want to drive<em>other peoples’</em>fast cars on a racetrack?!) but the interest – the<em>passion</em>– has never wavered. These experiences have influenced my choice of car in the GT-R and naturally these are the comparisons I’ll draw so hopefully that sets some context and saves the inevitable comments around “are you sure you can handle this new beast?!” :) In the immortal words of Ricky Bobby,<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riBA-FsJJmY\">I wanna go fast!</a>(in a controlled environment with the appropriate training and experience etc. etc.)</p><h4>Performance</h4><p>Let me start at the pointy end – the GT-R is ridiculously fast! I’ve been fortunate enough to drive a whole lot of fast cars on road and track but this is just another echelon of anything I’ve been near before. One of the best party tricks of the car is the ability to get from zero to 100 kph in under 3 seconds. Yes, that’s 3 as in t-h-r-e-e. A video speaks a thousand words here:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/P6mdFu67MP8?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><p>That's pretty much it – a combination of awe and laugh-out-loud disbelief at what the thing can do. I’ve taken a few people for drives now and the reaction is always simply sheer disbelief mixed with terror – you want to keep going back and doing it again and again. Basically the reaction is always just like<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvVwC-IJoLY\">this</a>(really wish I’d filmed some of them now).</p><p>The traction is what really makes it and that’s partly due to all wheel drive but as James says in the video above, it’s also due to the massive amount of computing power that’s able to assess the amount of slip that’s happening and control the electronic throttle – as well as front and rear torque distribution – that enables those astronomical acceleration figures.</p><p>In the isolated video above, it looks fast, but it’s not until you get some perspective against cars like the Ferrari 458 or V10 Audi that you get a sense of where that massive acceleration comes from:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/uDP7Pty8Qnw?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><p>It’s grip – massive, almost unparalleled traction (at least this side of a Bugatti Veyron) that gives the GT-R the jump. Once other cars with similar power but less weight hook up the game starts to change, but by then there’s several car lengths to be made up. Being all wheel drive is a significant part of it, but then the R8 GT is all wheel drive and has another 30 bhp (although a bit less torque) but 200 kg less weight and a fair whack more tyre size on the rear. There’s just a whole heap of smarts going on in the GT-R to carefully manage the balance of power delivery versus traction and at lower speeds where the former can easily overcome the latter, that’s a pretty critical attribute.</p><p>Going fast in a straight line is great, don’t get me wrong, but there are plenty of cars that can do that. Laying down a fast track time is a far more involving pursuit as now you’re looking at chassis dynamics, breaking, aero, durability plus of course power. Getting back to that Nürburgring lap, the 2010 model (which they call the 2011 model in America – you know, the one that was released in 2010!) got around in 7 minutes and 24 seconds. Some perspective helps here – go back to the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring_lap_times\">lap records</a>and that’s faster than a Pagani Zonda F Clubsport:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"339\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Pagani Zonda F Clubsport\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-TuUIToG5B1o/UeRpDJlJp7I/AAAAAAAAFd0/Ujljhq1oCbU/zonda2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>And even faster than a Ferrari Enzo:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"323\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Ferrari Enzo\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-KSQGMAoj6Kc/UeRpEIlxQ9I/AAAAAAAAFd8/4MFat97TkHw/ferrari2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Frankly that all gets a bit academic – newer GT-Rs are faster (<a href=\"http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1080223_2014-nissan-gt-r-preview\">allegedly 7:18</a>), other cars are in the ballpark (Corvette ZR1 at 7:20, Porsche 911 GT2 RS at 7:24 etc.) and that’s all great for bragging rights but not a whole lot else. Different tracks, different drivers different temperatures (turbos love cold, dense air) and everything changes.</p><p>Thing is though, you can fit the kids in the back of the GT-R and drive to the shops in it. Here’s what that Nürburgring lap looks like and frankly, some of it’s a little bit frightening:</p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ANvlNGMOets?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>Since that model there have been three annual refreshes that have brought more power, more torque plus gearbox and handling improvements. The thing that makes the GT-R a bit of an enigma in terms of speed is that it’s doing it with significantly less power-to-weight than cars like the Zonda and the Enzo – and that’s where the tech comes in. Let’s take a look under the covers and bit into the bits and bytes of what makes this a little bit special.</p><h4>Dual clutch gearbox</h4><p>Here’s the thing with gearboxes – and some people aren’t going to like this – the manual box is dead. No really, we got over a century out of them so they had a good run, but they’ve now been comprehensively superseded by modern alternatives. The most popular modern day successor involves automating the control of two separate clutches connected to their own gear sets (one with the even ones, one with the odds) and controlling the whole thing via clever software. We normally refer to this as a dual clutch ‘box and it looks like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"571\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Typical dual clutch architecture\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-allO2ghP9AE/UeRpEuvdscI/AAAAAAAAFeE/PN0J3pSScf0/Untitled-58.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is a seven speed Audi box but it illustrates the principle really well. In this example you can see the two clutches in the upper left with the first one which drives the odd gears activated and the second disengaged. You can see the 2nd gear already “preselected” or in other words, positioned such that once the second clutch is engaged everything is already in the right place. What it means is that changing up only involves disengaging the first clutch then engaging the second. Choosing which gear to preselect is simple conditional logic – accelerating? Get the next gear up ready. Braking? Get the next gear down.</p><p>The GT-R can complete the shuffle between clutches in about 100ms. Compare that to the process in the manual box – come off the throttle, depress the clutch via foot, select the next gear via hand, release the clutch then get back on the throttle. You’re looking at 500ms and up in most cases which is why the dual clutch boxes consistently out-accelerate the manual brethren to 100kph by a couple of hundred milliseconds. Get yourself into something like a<a href=\"http://blog.caranddriver.com/pagani-zonda-revolucion-going-out-with-a-bang/?spr_id=1458_9230393\">Pagani Zonda Revolucion</a>and the shift times are down to only 20ms which is mind boggling for what ultimately remains a mechanical process.</p><p>For daily driving, a dual clutch box means that software can start to do very clever things like pick the optimal gear for fuel efficiency. In fact this is another key reason why manufacturers – even of high performance vehicles – are going dual clutch as it means improved emissions results which they’re increasingly under pressure to achieve. As a driver, it means you can whack it in “auto” and drive it around just like a traditional automatic box but without the lethargy the vast majority of them suffer from. In fact for smart enough software, the car can even start to pull tricks such as<a href=\"https://www.press.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/pressclub/p/rr/pressDetail.html?title=world-debut-for-rolls-royce-wraith-at-geneva-motor-show&outputChannelId=4&id=T0137422EN&left_menu_item=node__789\">satellite aided transmission as seen in the Rolls Royce Wraith</a>where it will select the right gear based on the angle of the upcoming corner. Cool. I think.</p><p>This is all great for the daily commute in city traffic, but then you also get these:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"585\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Paddle shifters\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-OdYeEm_x5yU/UeRpFcUFOXI/AAAAAAAAFeM/rgAVvTkguqs/Paddle-shift2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Paddle shifters mated with a dual clutch box on a performance car give you new ways of driving. Firstly, you’re<em>usually</em>not taking your hands off the wheel to shift (unless you’ve wound on a lot of lock, usually at lower speed) so there’s no more either short shifting or holding higher RPM than you otherwise would<em>or</em>compromising on control by releasing the wheel. Then when you do shift up, the speed of the change means the flow of torque is<em>almost</em>unrelenting so it doesn’t unsettle the vehicle in the way it does in a manual. Many a driver has made an unexpected acquaintance with the concept of lift-off oversteer trying to shift up mid-corner!</p><p>The other thing about computers controlling the gearbox is that you get to do tricks like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"409\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Transmission, suspension and VDC switches\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ewPPjUxjACE/UeRpGAlD2LI/AAAAAAAAFeU/0ZBY-xTq1jA/Setup-switch-022.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>These are toggles for the transmission, suspension and vehicle dynamic control (VDC). The idea of adjusting these is that you get some control over aggression versus comfort. What does this look like? Well for example, when you’re driving around in auto mode (i.e. the computer decides when to shift), comfort mode won’t change gears as eagerly in response to changes in throttle position. Whack it into race mode and it’ll change far more vigorously and hold the gear for longer. Drive it in “manual” race mode and it’ll let you rev into redline. The computers aren’t always going to get it right, but a combination of different settings and learning how it responds to driver inputs gets you a pretty damn good balance.</p><p>I’ve had a great time with manual performance cars over the years; I couldn’t imagine a skidpan session without being able to pop the clutch for a sudden whack of traction-breaking torque and there were few moments as satisfying as a cleanly executed heel and toe in something as simple as a Mazda MX5 on the track. Then again, cars like the new Porsche GT3 (which now only comes in a dual clutch)<a href=\"http://carsalways.com/2013/03/06/2014-porsche-gt3-arrives-in-geneva/\">can engage the clutch by pulling both paddles</a>(remember folks, it’s only software) and as for the satisfaction of driving a manual quickly, that was more about the ability to overcome a challenge than it was about going fast!</p><h4>Front-engined, rear-mounted transaxle gearbox</h4><p>Here’s how your typical drive train gets put together: Engine and gearbox go into the front, drive goes out to the wheels and if that means the rear ones (either rear wheel drive or all-wheel drive) then you get a single drive shaft sending torque to a rear diff. Of course there are variances (namely mid-engined vehicles like a Ferrari 458 or rear-engined like a Porsche 911), but this architecture accounts for the vast majority of vehicles out there.</p><p>The problem is that this means a hell of lot of weight goes into the front of the car and the problem with that is that it doesn’t do great things for balance. There’s a lot of inertia sitting over the front wheels which means turn-in suffers (the ability quickly tip the car into a corner) as that great big whack of mass up front wants to keep travelling in straight line rather than changing direction. A gearbox is also a big piece of kit so putting it up front causes other compromises such as pushing the engine even further forward therefore exaggerating the forward leaning weight problem, pushing it up higher which impacts the centre of gravity and increases body roll or protruding into cabin space. But putting the engine and gearbox up front is extremely cost effective plus it means you can actually do something with the space at the back of the vehicle, such as put stuff in it!</p><p>Here’s what the GT-R does:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"282\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Cutaway of engine and gearbox\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-nXOVLbYAH8g/UeRpGuw760I/AAAAAAAAFec/qSsDHBSDhho/Untitled-131.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>You can see the gearbox sitting down under the rear seats which means a whole lot of weight moves backwards. Not an even amount, mind you, there’s still 53% over the front axle but that’s an exceptionally good balance for a front-engined vehicle. The transaxle part comes in when the rear diff is baked into the gearbox rather than being a separate unit which means it looks like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"410\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Top view of gearbox\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-I0c04vy6f3g/UeRpHaNNYhI/AAAAAAAAFek/m1NWgsGQAtI/Untitled-45.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>The right side of the picture shows the diff mounted to the rear of the gearbox and it’s from here that drive is sent to the rear wheels. Back on the left hand side you can see a cutaway exposing the clutches just behind where drive enters the box.</p><p>This approach isn’t unique to the GT-R, the same front-engined rear-mounted transaxle configuration can be found in cars like the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta and Mercedes SLS AMG. However, here’s the big difference with the GT-R:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"366\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"GT-R running gear\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-QoSxPZt0i8U/UeRpH0qi0wI/AAAAAAAAFes/vMPxdg8MRB4/Untitled-12.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Unlike the European comparables, the GT-R is all wheel drive so it has to get torque from the gearbox back up to the front wheels and therefore has a second drive shaft which you can see just above the centreline of the vehicle (you can also see the mounts for this in the top left of the prior gearbox picture). This makes it unique for a transaxle configuration and whilst a bit verbose in terms of the hardware required, it means it gets that beautiful weight distribution between front and rear.</p><p>Incidentally, the primary drive shaft from running from the engine to the gearbox is a carbon composite job. Very light, very little flex and<em>extremely</em>strong.</p><h4>Engine</h4><p>It’s a 3.8 Litre V6 but that alone isn’t what makes it special, there’s a number of different tricks that turn the otherwise rather mainstream capacity into something altogether more ballistic. The most obvious addition is a couple of turbos, each one feeding into a cylinder bank either side of the longitudinally mounted engine. It all looks a bit like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"GT-R engine bay\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-AXbNNz8x1ys/UeRpJet72fI/AAAAAAAAFe0/DNF4MAPr6Uc/engine011em34.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>You can see it mounted as far back as possible in the engine bay which is another part of the great front-to-rear weight distribution I touched on earlier.</p><p>The bores don’t have cylinder liners, instead they’re plasma coated or more specifically,<a href=\"http://jalopnik.com/5467038/the-ford-engine-technology-good-enough-for-the-nissan-gt+r\">plasma transfer wire arc thermal sprayed</a>. This takes the mass of the traditionally cast iron liners out of the engine.</p><p>Then there’s the turbos:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"555\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Headers and turbos\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Fdbafx6rHhU/UeRpKHbselI/AAAAAAAAFe8/sgpMn1Y9zt0/Turbo%25255B7%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Ordinarily, each of the units you see above would be two separate parts; the turbo (consisting of both the exhaust and intake turbines) and the headers which take emissions from the engine then feed it down usually some distance (depending on the engine packaging) through exhaust plumbing. The GT-R packs the exhaust turbine into the header (you can see it’s one cast unit) so the packaging is smaller and the lag between engine and turbine is reduced.</p><p>Poking around the car shows up all sorts of tricky packaging, cooling and general tricks to extract the levels of performance it achieves, not just for short bursts but for prolonged high performance driving.</p><h4>Instrumentation</h4><p>Here’s the real tech porn bit that’ll resonate with the inner-techie – the multi-function display:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Multi-function device\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-2-r68mfxNHw/UeRpK6qUFtI/AAAAAAAAFfE/k1XJMnM3wlg/Center-display2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is like Task Manager for cars and it can spit out a wealth of information in different formats. Instrumentation in vehicles – even high performance vehicles – is usually limited to things like speed, RPM and a very vague engine temp gauge. In the GT-R, you get stuff like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"MFD lateral g-forces\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-9-vMj-LNjeo/UeRpLtctjQI/AAAAAAAAFfM/UArkaUA4pD4/Multi-function-meters-034.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Longitudinal G forces (i.e. the rate of acceleration) combined with boost pressure (effectively how hard the turbos are working to force air into the engine) and the amount of acceleration potential actually being used. But that’s just the start, you also get stuff like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"MFD guages\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-jTjPaPBy6Wk/UeRpMY3NsRI/AAAAAAAAFfU/RCAJ2G7Sl3w/Multi-function-meters-024.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>The distribution of torque from front to rear is especially interesting as it can dramatically change the behaviour of the car. The STi had the ability to shuffle torque backwards and forwards as well but there was always a significant portion going through the front wheels which made it hard to exploit some of the more desirable attributes of a rear wheel drive platform such as power-on oversteer.</p><p>All in all, you get 18 different system metrics that can be represented on the LCD:</p><ol><li>Engine Coolant Temperature</li><li>Engine Oil Temperature</li><li>Engine Oil Pressure</li><li>Transmission Oil Temperature</li><li>Transmission Oil Pressure</li><li>Boost</li><li>Speed</li><li>Fuel/Range</li><li>Fuel Flow</li><li>Recent Fuel Economy</li><li>Torque split</li><li>Accel pedal</li><li>Brake pedal</li><li>Steering angle</li><li>Cornering g-force</li><li>Accel/Braking g-force</li><li>Total g-force</li><li>Clock (yay!)</li></ol><p>The<a href=\"http://www.nissan-techinfo.com/refgh0v/og/gt-r/2013-Nissan-GTR-MFD-Navi.pdf\">manual for the MFD</a>goes on about the various functions and how they can be represented on screen and frankly many of them are not a lot of use. Things like g-forces are kind of neat for geek value, but even on the track you’d go for dedicated instrumentation designed for maximising lap times. Fluid temps, however, really are useful and once you have an accurate oil temp gauge (as I did courtesy of an aftermarket one in the STi), you realise just how long it takes the car (any car, for that matter), to get to a temp where oils are actually at an optimal temp to do their job properly. Many a car has been driven hard too early and suffered rather unpleasant consequences as a result.</p><h4>Aero</h4><p>There are two big problems cars face the faster the go: drag and downforce. Too much of the first seriously dents acceleration (and fuel economy), not enough of the latter makes it harder to go around corners at pace. But the two objectives can also be counter-productive as creating downforce also crates drag. This is one of the reasons why we’re seeing more and more active aerodynamics so the car can be sleek when it needs to but then disrupt the airflow enough to apply downforce to different parts of the vehicle as required (check out<a href=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5231/5898330381_05dd547f82_o.jpg\">the flaps on a Pagani Huayra</a>if you’re not sure what this looks like). But I digress…</p><p>The GT-R focuses primary on drag and as a result has very low drag coefficient of 0.26, about lineball with a Toyota Prius. Against the competition, that’s amazingly efficient: Porsche Turbo is 0.31 (less is better when it comes to drag), a Ferrari California is 0.32 and even a recent model Corvette is 0.29. You’ll get slightly lower than that on some economy-focussed cars (take a few hundredths off) but you need to remember that performance cars are also trying to generate downforce so the previous performance car comparables are the real interesting bits.</p><p>So how does it do it? Aero always comes downs to lots of little tweaks, for example the door handles:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"404\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Door handle\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-SZr9PItKOSA/UeRpM_7tR_I/AAAAAAAAFfc/AwcQkznkTPM/Untitled-62.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Of more significance is the underbody (in fact a huge amount of drag originates under the chassis):</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"359\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Underbody\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-kbGFiuKhgK0/UeRpNiIR3tI/AAAAAAAAFfk/yVtaFGC1nFA/Untitled-13.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>You can see the smooth profile courtesy of scuff plates, a diffuser and other facades that attempt to smooth the airflow by keeping all the pointy bits out of the way. But there’s a whole lot of subtleties that aren’t immediately obvious; I put mine up on the hoist at my mechanic’s last week and found a whole bunch of goodies. For example, the three cooling ducts you can see in the black panels just in front of the rear wheels. That middle one feeds air directly onto the heat sink on the gearbox then passes it out through the duct behind it. There’s also a phenomenal amount of bracing, for example you can just see the vertical bar in front of the two catalytic converters behind the panels under the front of the car. There’s another very significant brace just behind the cats which passes over the exhaust just before the two pipes go into one. Not exactly aero any more but quite interesting whilst we’re looking at the underside.</p><p>Then of course there’s the entire body profile with that classic coupe shape which is always going to play nice with airflow:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"358\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Body aerodynamics\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-A4ljuIGQnCE/UeRpOEXgoXI/AAAAAAAAFfs/Zemuok8CL5s/Untitled-22.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>One thing that’s very unique about the GT-R though is the hard edges on many of the surfaces. You can see it on the trailing edge of the vents just behind the front wheels in the picture above but it’s really evident when you look at the way the sides of the body join the rear of the car:</p><p><img width=\"600\" height=\"503\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Trailing edge of body\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ykWS6hw9XmA/UeRpO5FtLfI/AAAAAAAAFf0/XYLoel9tBHE/Taillights2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>They’re damned near right angles and the lighting in that pic really illustrates just how sharp the lines are. Aesthetically, it doesn’t have the beauty of a curvaceous Porsche 911 but there’s something very functional, very Japanese about the whole design.</p><p>One of the things that really bugs me in automotive design is<em>over</em>-design; features that have no functional value and just appear tacked on for some sort of odd aesthetic value. Think Apple’s skeuomorphic approach (and we all know how that’s ended up). For example, I thoroughly dislike how Subaru has added faux vents to the front and rear bumpers:</p><p><img width=\"400\" height=\"263\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Front fake vent of a Subaru STi\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Mx5EqcOsLQc/UeRpPev-EJI/AAAAAAAAFf8/-E_eCwq2YSc/2009-Subaru-Impreza-Wrx-Sti-A-Line-D%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"> <img width=\"400\" height=\"263\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Rear fake vents of a Subaru WRX\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-wWHErtgEmiE/UeRpP3DWA4I/AAAAAAAAFgE/XQoLOedXOQc/p5.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>You know what these are?<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAPmqX-FyvU\">Speed holes</a>:</p><p><img width=\"532\" height=\"426\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Simpsons speed holes\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-gSN2hu-Aamw/UeRpQSlu_yI/AAAAAAAAFgM/YrN87_ADFXY/O5HtQ2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Living with the GT-R for a little while you start to notice all the aero nuances that don’t really come through in the pictures earlier on, things like the protrusion beneath the wing mirrors (a particularly aerodynamically inefficient piece of equipment):</p><p><img width=\"434\" height=\"326\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Wing mirror aero\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-OXptgNpIlRA/UeRpRHc16lI/AAAAAAAAFgU/bvyLO0Zqauc/nissan_10gtr_mirror_Large2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Or the subtleties in the rear wing design like the slightly raised ends, streamlined protrusions just above the mounting points or just how far back beyond the boot lid it actually extends:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"334\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Rear spolier\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-9XJy3VDkSMQ/UeRpRxzq6KI/AAAAAAAAFgc/kzfGuOvJZHY/2012-Nissan-GT-R-Egoist-Carbon-Rear-.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Then there’s the vents behind the front wheel arches –<em>real</em>vents – that draw heat from the engine bay through the negative pressure area created behind the contour of the arch:</p><p><img width=\"801\" height=\"500\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Vents behind wheels to draw air from engine bay\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-xUC18lbGbX0/UeRpSQjdK2I/AAAAAAAAFgk/XHsJ90osuUI/Nissan-GTR-052.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>All of this (and much, much more) adds up to contribute to that low drag coefficient. It’s little pieces like the drag, the transmission and the grip that add up to that massive performance that’s so far beyond what it<em>should</em>be capable of based on power and weight alone. The big question though is:</p><h4>But what’s it like to drive?</h4><p>Violent. Well actually, it’s docile then it’s violent, I mean you can drive it around town in auto with everything in comfort mode and it’s not much different to many mainstream cars. Probably the main compromise is the ride although it’s still comfier than the STi and the ground clearance is only<em>fractionally</em>less. But then you flick the transmission and traction into R, whack the shifter into manual mode and it all goes a bit Millennium-Falcon-in-hyperdrive.</p><p>First gear can’t get all the power down so the traction control has a job managing that before you whack into the rev limiter. Second hits hard as the RPM is already up there so it pulls<em>very</em>strongly into third and that’s about as much as I can, uh, publicly say until it sees a racetrack :)</p><p>What I can say though is that in second the back will still let go if tipped into a corner hard enough and that’s on a bone dry road. The traction control in race mode though gives it a big whack of slip and combined with some opposite lock it pulls it back dead straight (if you’re quick) and just powers on to redline. Probably the biggest surprise actually is just how rear-orientated the power delivery is, in many ways it drives more like the powerful rear wheel drive cars I had before the Subarus. The latter would tend towards understeer and the only way you’re getting out of that is to ease off the throttle while the former would oversteer at the drop of a hat and need to be balanced on the throttle and steering, assuming you weren’t already facing in the wrong direction.</p><p>Again, it’s the computers that nail it in the GT-R. They give you the slip to get tail happy but reign it in at just the right time to not just save you from yourself but to go faster than if they weren’t there. Times gone by (and in many current generation cars), the computers just get in the way behaving in an obtrusive fashion that kills both fun and pace. Top Gear mag summarised the modern day electronic nanny as follows:</p><blockquote><p>These days, you don’t drive around the traction-control systems. You drive straight into them, and go faster</p></blockquote><p>That’s what it feels like in the GT-R – not intrusive at the limit of adhesion (at least not in race mode), rather complimentary in the best way possible in terms of outright speed. Like the WRX though, the grip thresholds are that much higher than your average performance vehicle that when it<em>does</em>let go it can be at a serious rate of knots which means it might not always end well.</p><p>The other thing about the GT-R is the reaction it brings out of others. The day my wife and I got the car we had schoolkids and senior citizens alike come up and talk about it, the latter couple describing how this was their son’s dream car and would be the first purchase after a lotto win before a house (pro tip: invest first then buy toys!) The enthusiasm extends to the road with other cars regularly jostling for the right spot so the driver can unashamedly ogle the black beast. Even kids on bikes the other day were stopping mid-crossing and gawking then giving thumbs up and leaving with big smiles. Whilst I’m sure not all run ins will be positive, most of them pretty much<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=_Ejo-bKC2nY\">go like this</a>and that can really make your day :)</p><p>Speaking of kids, yes, they fit. Frankly that’s one of the most significant things about the car, that it can do everything above<em>and</em>still carry family. It’s not<em>the</em>family car and nor will it ever be, but it can comfortably get away with it when it needs to. On the practicality front, the fuel economy was a bit of a shock – it’s better than the STi by a fair margin and even fractionally less than our R36 VW (the<em>real</em>family car). A week of Sydney traffic commute would normally see the Subaru around 15.5L/100km and the dub dub about 14.5, the GT-R has been running at low 14s which is a rather nice surprise. I suspect it’s a combination of the fact that it gets into high gears quickly and has enough torque to maintain them without constantly shuffling them. It’s a lot more stable than the DSG in the VW in that regard.</p><p>Enough of that, let’s get to the drive video and if you’re just after the windy road bits, flick through to 15:00 with the best sections of road from about 21:00. It’s only public roads and there’s mostly armco on one side and rocks or trees on the other with no run-off (plus the desire to preserve my license!) so until I get to a track it’s going to be a bit restrained. What doesn’t really come through looking at it again now is just how brutal the acceleration is out of corners, that and the smoother you drive the slower it looks so I’ll try and sort out some better camera angles on track.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ejo-bKC2nY?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><p>Apologies for the slight static and for some rather mundane sections, I recorded the audio on iPhone and didn’t realise the mic was rubbing on my shirt then I realised I don’t know what the hell I’m doing in iMovie and cropping things just got too hard. Sorry!</p><h4>Next</h4><p>Where do you go from here? Well firstly, I’ll give it some track time but don’t feel the same itch like I did a decade ago. I’ll probably take it out for some demo runs next driver training day and enjoy it with others. Then there’s always mods – do enough work and they’re<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaYTqAaPD5w&feature=youtu.be\">significantly outpacing a Bugatti Veyron Supersport</a>. We don’t really have either the roads or motorsport events down here to take advantage of that sort of behaviour but the classic exhaust and tune may feature later on.</p><p>But for the most part, it’s now just about enjoying the machine, reflecting on the path that has taken us here and trying to get out of the city more to actually enjoy it. Oh – and sharing the experience with friends. So who’s coming for a ride? :)</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/hjQnxQG9oe0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":404}}

Not<em>knowing</em>you’ve had a security incident is not the same as not having had a security incident and there are some interesting precedents that illustrate this rather well.</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Specious reasoning</h4><p>See if<a href=\"http://www.reference.com/motif/society/specious-reasoning\">this</a>resonates:</p><blockquote><p>Specious reasoning is an argument which seems to be followed by and described with valid points, but which is in reality misleading or false. The proof used in these lines of reasoning are often speculations that could be possibilities but are in no way actually backed up by any evidence or truth. Specious reasoning can give great comic effect and is used often in television and movies to add levity to caricatures of conspiracy theorists and cast members that are meant to be viewed as ignorant or uneducated.</p></blockquote><p>That’s pretty much the argument of never having been hacked –<em>speculations that could be possibilities but are in no way actually backed up by any evidence or truth</em>. Let me give you another example related to<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/5-ways-to-implement-https-in.html\">my piece on Top CashBack</a>a few months ago. TechWeek Europe sought feedback from their technical director who stated:</p><blockquote><p>Mike Tomkins, technical director and one of the founders of TopCashback, said there had never been a breach of a customers’ bank account as a result of poor security on the site.</p></blockquote><p>Ok, I also read the bit about specious reasoning giving “great comic effect” but c’mon, this is just ridiculous! This was in response to my writing about numerous deficiencies in their HTTPS implementation after their Twitter account espoused the efficacy of some pretty mediocre practices. When insufficient HTTPS implementations are attacked it’s by a man<em>in the middle</em>or in other words, an attacker compromising the transport layer. That might mean the sniffing of wifi traffic or other similar attacks that are absolutely nowhere near the server itself. An attacker does not leave a helpful note somewhere after intercepting unprotected traffic – there are usually no obvious indicators of compromise.</p><p>Words such as Mike’s are nothing more than an attempt to build confidence without any basis of evidence whatsoever on which to do so. Of course he could have said “We are not aware of any previous breaches of customers’ bank account” but that doesn’t sound quite as convincing, does it?</p><p>The thing is, no matter how confident you are about your security position you cannot emphatically say that you haven’t had any breaches. Not convinced? Let’s look at a couple of examples that illustrate this.</p><h4>Advanced persistent threats</h4><p>Last week there was an article in Secure Computing Mag about<a href=\"http://www.scmagazine.com/hack-exposes-morningstar-data-on-182k-investors-including-some-credit-card-numbers/article/302318/\">182,000 accounts at investment research company Morningstar being compromised</a>. Unfortunate, but not uncommon. This statement, however, is rather interesting:</p><blockquote><p>An intrusion in April 2012 is thought to have compromised the Morningstar Document Research, formerly 10-K Wizard, which provides a global database and search tool to the company.</p></blockquote><p>What?! That’s 15 months ago and they only know about it<em>now?!</em>Had someone from Morningstar been asked about their security position during those 15 months in the same way Mike Tomkins from Top CashBack had been, how do you think they would have responded? Exactly.</p><p>Back on SC Mag again, in May they reported how<a href=\"http://www.scmagazine.com/hackers-may-have-had-access-to-resorts-credit-card-system-for-eight-months/article/295395/\">hackers may have had access to resort's credit card system for eight months</a>. This time it was Callaway Gardens and the resort unfortunately had some nasty Malware running for some time:</p><blockquote><p>According to a Callaway Gardens spokeswoman, the breach started in early September.</p></blockquote><p>Now keep in mind that this is<em>malware</em>– malicious software running on one or more compromised machines – the sort of stuff that’s often not overly difficult to detect (with some notable exceptions). Certainly it’s generally more overt than sniffed network traffic yet Callaway Gardens didn’t know it was there until well after the damage had already been done.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat\">Advanced persistent threats</a>(or APTs) are a well-established phenomenon and<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat\">Wikipedia summarises it nicely</a>:</p><p><img width=\"500\" height=\"496\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Diagram depicting the life cycle staged approach of an advanced persistent threat (APT) which repeats itself once complete\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-FaC-ItP1WM4/UeZd0QW8cJI/AAAAAAAAFg8/vpOHG4i_92c/Advanced_persistent_threat_lifecycle%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>They also refer to a recent report from<a href=\"http://intelreport.mandiant.com/\">Mandiant</a>exposing cyber espionage originating in China where they make the following findings with regards to APTs:</p><blockquote><p>In incidents analysed by Mandiant, the average period over which the attackers controlled victim's network was one year, with longest – almost five years</p></blockquote><p>That’s not too inconsistent with the previous SC Mag articles – about a year, give or take, before the victim actually realises what’s going on. If they ever do.</p><h4>Ignorance is bliss (at least until complacency gets you pwned)</h4><p>The attitudes described at the beginning of this post – the one about never having had security issues stemming from a risk then Mike’s from Top CashBack – are dangerously wrong. They breed complacency and demonstrate arrogance in the sense they imply that if these individuals are not aware of a breach then surely they could not have occurred. Specious reasoning indeed.</p><p>More than just ignorance to the basic mechanics of how website attacks often work though, these responses demonstrate a dangerous level of ongoing complacency. In the example from the opening paragraph of this post, the website in question stores plain text passwords in a cookie, doesn’t flag them as HttpOnly, has XSS flaws, emails passwords in plain text, locks out old credentials on password reset, emails a persistent short password of limited character set on reset, has mixed mode HTTPS flaws and sends the session ID over insecure connections. They know this and deem it acceptable. They hold personal data. They handle credit cards.</p><p>But don’t worry folks, they’ve not had a single security issue. To date…</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/bhpP1qyGjmM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":433}}

The Japanese have been making GT-Rs on and off for 44 years now but they really gained notoriety in the 90s as the top spec variants of their Skyline model. Down here where we only got a few of the machines on the local market, the Aussie press named it “Godzilla” for its monstrous performance ability and motorsport domination. The name kinda stuck around the world. It was so dominant in our local motorsport that it lead to the now infamous<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jOqmjSk0mI\">pack of arseholes speech</a>by our racing luminary Jim Richards after continued domination of a category that was usually the domain of rather mechanically basic front-engine, rear wheel drive V8s.</p><p>There was a 7 year GT-R hiatus from 2002 but come 2009 the car you see above arrived although this time it was built as a GT-R from the ground up and was no longer a hot version of the Skyline platform. From the outset, Nissan set a massively high performance bar clearly targeting Porsche’s 911 Turbo and spending a great whack of time on Germany’s<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring\">Nürburgring</a>(a long time benchmark for performance cars) and generally did a lot of chest-beating about<a href=\"http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_111189/title_Nissan-GTR-The-Supercar-for-Anyone-Anytime-Anywhere/newsarticle.html\">Anyone, Anytime, Anywhere</a>.</p><p>That’s enough of the history lesson, let’s get into the good bits! And yes, there is some video I’ve put together down the very end.</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Background</h4><p>Just a quick bit of context; the GT-R has replaced my much-loved, much “exercised” Subaru WRX STi:</p><p><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"STi at Wakefield\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ofdI_aFZQX0/UeRpBXCpvbI/AAAAAAAAFdc/I9LURjdCzjM/STi-At-Wakefield14.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"> <img width=\"267\" height=\"200\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"STi at Eastern Creek Skidpan\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/--KI6LGe2aHk/UeRpB70pJBI/AAAAAAAAFdk/WwiEM5DxJjM/166_7352230508_6316_n4.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"> <img width=\"267\" height=\"200\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"STi at Oran Park dirt motorkhana\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-hx5gwqJuECQ/UeRpCpkVyjI/AAAAAAAAFds/mduRcjO9jzg/166_7352220508_5863_n3.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Clearly it didn’t lead a gentle life! The STi was regularly used for club motorsport events, most often in “rally skills” events which were predominantly skidpans and dirt motorkhanas so it got a lot of<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXLREc9Nnv0&feature=c4-overview&playnext=1&list=TLcx18FZM1lX0\">this</a>. It was a great car, very well setup with just the right modifications for both road and track and took me to a club championship back in ‘07. It got some track time but I mostly got that out of my system with the previous WRX which saw<em>a heap</em>of competitive motorsport between 2000 and 2005 which meant a lot of<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW4U9Dwic2Q\">this</a>(class record that day too, thank you very much!)</p><p>So fast cars and active involvement in motorsport have been a passion for many years now and brought many fantastic experiences. In more recent years I’ve kept track time mostly to instructing duties (c’mon, who doesn’t want to drive<em>other peoples’</em>fast cars on a racetrack?!) but the interest – the<em>passion</em>– has never wavered. These experiences have influenced my choice of car in the GT-R and naturally these are the comparisons I’ll draw so hopefully that sets some context and saves the inevitable comments around “are you sure you can handle this new beast?!” :) In the immortal words of Ricky Bobby,<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riBA-FsJJmY\">I wanna go fast!</a>(in a controlled environment with the appropriate training and experience etc. etc.)</p><h4>Performance</h4><p>Let me start at the pointy end – the GT-R is ridiculously fast! I’ve been fortunate enough to drive a whole lot of fast cars on road and track but this is just another echelon of anything I’ve been near before. One of the best party tricks of the car is the ability to get from zero to 100 kph in under 3 seconds. Yes, that’s 3 as in t-h-r-e-e. A video speaks a thousand words here:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/P6mdFu67MP8?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><p>That's pretty much it – a combination of awe and laugh-out-loud disbelief at what the thing can do. I’ve taken a few people for drives now and the reaction is always simply sheer disbelief mixed with terror – you want to keep going back and doing it again and again. Basically the reaction is always just like<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvVwC-IJoLY\">this</a>(really wish I’d filmed some of them now).</p><p>The traction is what really makes it and that’s partly due to all wheel drive but as James says in the video above, it’s also due to the massive amount of computing power that’s able to assess the amount of slip that’s happening and control the electronic throttle – as well as front and rear torque distribution – that enables those astronomical acceleration figures.</p><p>In the isolated video above, it looks fast, but it’s not until you get some perspective against cars like the Ferrari 458 or V10 Audi that you get a sense of where that massive acceleration comes from:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/uDP7Pty8Qnw?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><p>It’s grip – massive, almost unparalleled traction (at least this side of a Bugatti Veyron) that gives the GT-R the jump. Once other cars with similar power but less weight hook up the game starts to change, but by then there’s several car lengths to be made up. Being all wheel drive is a significant part of it, but then the R8 GT is all wheel drive and has another 30 bhp (although a bit less torque) but 200 kg less weight and a fair whack more tyre size on the rear. There’s just a whole heap of smarts going on in the GT-R to carefully manage the balance of power delivery versus traction and at lower speeds where the former can easily overcome the latter, that’s a pretty critical attribute.</p><p>Going fast in a straight line is great, don’t get me wrong, but there are plenty of cars that can do that. Laying down a fast track time is a far more involving pursuit as now you’re looking at chassis dynamics, breaking, aero, durability plus of course power. Getting back to that Nürburgring lap, the 2010 model (which they call the 2011 model in America – you know, the one that was released in 2010!) got around in 7 minutes and 24 seconds. Some perspective helps here – go back to the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring_lap_times\">lap records</a>and that’s faster than a Pagani Zonda F Clubsport:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"339\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Pagani Zonda F Clubsport\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-TuUIToG5B1o/UeRpDJlJp7I/AAAAAAAAFd0/Ujljhq1oCbU/zonda2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>And even faster than a Ferrari Enzo:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"323\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Ferrari Enzo\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-KSQGMAoj6Kc/UeRpEIlxQ9I/AAAAAAAAFd8/4MFat97TkHw/ferrari2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Frankly that all gets a bit academic – newer GT-Rs are faster (<a href=\"http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1080223_2014-nissan-gt-r-preview\">allegedly 7:18</a>), other cars are in the ballpark (Corvette ZR1 at 7:20, Porsche 911 GT2 RS at 7:24 etc.) and that’s all great for bragging rights but not a whole lot else. Different tracks, different drivers different temperatures (turbos love cold, dense air) and everything changes.</p><p>Thing is though, you can fit the kids in the back of the GT-R and drive to the shops in it. Here’s what that Nürburgring lap looks like and frankly, some of it’s a little bit frightening:</p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ANvlNGMOets?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>Since that model there have been three annual refreshes that have brought more power, more torque plus gearbox and handling improvements. The thing that makes the GT-R a bit of an enigma in terms of speed is that it’s doing it with significantly less power-to-weight than cars like the Zonda and the Enzo – and that’s where the tech comes in. Let’s take a look under the covers and bit into the bits and bytes of what makes this a little bit special.</p><h4>Dual clutch gearbox</h4><p>Here’s the thing with gearboxes – and some people aren’t going to like this – the manual box is dead. No really, we got over a century out of them so they had a good run, but they’ve now been comprehensively superseded by modern alternatives. The most popular modern day successor involves automating the control of two separate clutches connected to their own gear sets (one with the even ones, one with the odds) and controlling the whole thing via clever software. We normally refer to this as a dual clutch ‘box and it looks like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"571\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Typical dual clutch architecture\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-allO2ghP9AE/UeRpEuvdscI/AAAAAAAAFeE/PN0J3pSScf0/Untitled-58.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is a seven speed Audi box but it illustrates the principle really well. In this example you can see the two clutches in the upper left with the first one which drives the odd gears activated and the second disengaged. You can see the 2nd gear already “preselected” or in other words, positioned such that once the second clutch is engaged everything is already in the right place. What it means is that changing up only involves disengaging the first clutch then engaging the second. Choosing which gear to preselect is simple conditional logic – accelerating? Get the next gear up ready. Braking? Get the next gear down.</p><p>The GT-R can complete the shuffle between clutches in about 100ms. Compare that to the process in the manual box – come off the throttle, depress the clutch via foot, select the next gear via hand, release the clutch then get back on the throttle. You’re looking at 500ms and up in most cases which is why the dual clutch boxes consistently out-accelerate the manual brethren to 100kph by a couple of hundred milliseconds. Get yourself into something like a<a href=\"http://blog.caranddriver.com/pagani-zonda-revolucion-going-out-with-a-bang/?spr_id=1458_9230393\">Pagani Zonda Revolucion</a>and the shift times are down to only 20ms which is mind boggling for what ultimately remains a mechanical process.</p><p>For daily driving, a dual clutch box means that software can start to do very clever things like pick the optimal gear for fuel efficiency. In fact this is another key reason why manufacturers – even of high performance vehicles – are going dual clutch as it means improved emissions results which they’re increasingly under pressure to achieve. As a driver, it means you can whack it in “auto” and drive it around just like a traditional automatic box but without the lethargy the vast majority of them suffer from. In fact for smart enough software, the car can even start to pull tricks such as<a href=\"https://www.press.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/pressclub/p/rr/pressDetail.html?title=world-debut-for-rolls-royce-wraith-at-geneva-motor-show&outputChannelId=4&id=T0137422EN&left_menu_item=node__789\">satellite aided transmission as seen in the Rolls Royce Wraith</a>where it will select the right gear based on the angle of the upcoming corner. Cool. I think.</p><p>This is all great for the daily commute in city traffic, but then you also get these:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"585\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Paddle shifters\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-OdYeEm_x5yU/UeRpFcUFOXI/AAAAAAAAFeM/rgAVvTkguqs/Paddle-shift2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Paddle shifters mated with a dual clutch box on a performance car give you new ways of driving. Firstly, you’re<em>usually</em>not taking your hands off the wheel to shift (unless you’ve wound on a lot of lock, usually at lower speed) so there’s no more either short shifting or holding higher RPM than you otherwise would<em>or</em>compromising on control by releasing the wheel. Then when you do shift up, the speed of the change means the flow of torque is<em>almost</em>unrelenting so it doesn’t unsettle the vehicle in the way it does in a manual. Many a driver has made an unexpected acquaintance with the concept of lift-off oversteer trying to shift up mid-corner!</p><p>The other thing about computers controlling the gearbox is that you get to do tricks like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"409\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Transmission, suspension and VDC switches\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ewPPjUxjACE/UeRpGAlD2LI/AAAAAAAAFeU/0ZBY-xTq1jA/Setup-switch-022.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>These are toggles for the transmission, suspension and vehicle dynamic control (VDC). The idea of adjusting these is that you get some control over aggression versus comfort. What does this look like? Well for example, when you’re driving around in auto mode (i.e. the computer decides when to shift), comfort mode won’t change gears as eagerly in response to changes in throttle position. Whack it into race mode and it’ll change far more vigorously and hold the gear for longer. Drive it in “manual” race mode and it’ll let you rev into redline. The computers aren’t always going to get it right, but a combination of different settings and learning how it responds to driver inputs gets you a pretty damn good balance.</p><p>I’ve had a great time with manual performance cars over the years; I couldn’t imagine a skidpan session without being able to pop the clutch for a sudden whack of traction-breaking torque and there were few moments as satisfying as a cleanly executed heel and toe in something as simple as a Mazda MX5 on the track. Then again, cars like the new Porsche GT3 (which now only comes in a dual clutch)<a href=\"http://carsalways.com/2013/03/06/2014-porsche-gt3-arrives-in-geneva/\">can engage the clutch by pulling both paddles</a>(remember folks, it’s only software) and as for the satisfaction of driving a manual quickly, that was more about the ability to overcome a challenge than it was about going fast!</p><h4>Front-engined, rear-mounted transaxle gearbox</h4><p>Here’s how your typical drive train gets put together: Engine and gearbox go into the front, drive goes out to the wheels and if that means the rear ones (either rear wheel drive or all-wheel drive) then you get a single drive shaft sending torque to a rear diff. Of course there are variances (namely mid-engined vehicles like a Ferrari 458 or rear-engined like a Porsche 911), but this architecture accounts for the vast majority of vehicles out there.</p><p>The problem is that this means a hell of lot of weight goes into the front of the car and the problem with that is that it doesn’t do great things for balance. There’s a lot of inertia sitting over the front wheels which means turn-in suffers (the ability quickly tip the car into a corner) as that great big whack of mass up front wants to keep travelling in straight line rather than changing direction. A gearbox is also a big piece of kit so putting it up front causes other compromises such as pushing the engine even further forward therefore exaggerating the forward leaning weight problem, pushing it up higher which impacts the centre of gravity and increases body roll or protruding into cabin space. But putting the engine and gearbox up front is extremely cost effective plus it means you can actually do something with the space at the back of the vehicle, such as put stuff in it!</p><p>Here’s what the GT-R does:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"282\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Cutaway of engine and gearbox\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-nXOVLbYAH8g/UeRpGuw760I/AAAAAAAAFec/qSsDHBSDhho/Untitled-131.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>You can see the gearbox sitting down under the rear seats which means a whole lot of weight moves backwards. Not an even amount, mind you, there’s still 53% over the front axle but that’s an exceptionally good balance for a front-engined vehicle. The transaxle part comes in when the rear diff is baked into the gearbox rather than being a separate unit which means it looks like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"410\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Top view of gearbox\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-I0c04vy6f3g/UeRpHaNNYhI/AAAAAAAAFek/m1NWgsGQAtI/Untitled-45.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>The right side of the picture shows the diff mounted to the rear of the gearbox and it’s from here that drive is sent to the rear wheels. Back on the left hand side you can see a cutaway exposing the clutches just behind where drive enters the box.</p><p>This approach isn’t unique to the GT-R, the same front-engined rear-mounted transaxle configuration can be found in cars like the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta and Mercedes SLS AMG. However, here’s the big difference with the GT-R:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"366\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"GT-R running gear\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-QoSxPZt0i8U/UeRpH0qi0wI/AAAAAAAAFes/vMPxdg8MRB4/Untitled-12.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Unlike the European comparables, the GT-R is all wheel drive so it has to get torque from the gearbox back up to the front wheels and therefore has a second drive shaft which you can see just above the centreline of the vehicle (you can also see the mounts for this in the top left of the prior gearbox picture). This makes it unique for a transaxle configuration and whilst a bit verbose in terms of the hardware required, it means it gets that beautiful weight distribution between front and rear.</p><p>Incidentally, the primary drive shaft from running from the engine to the gearbox is a carbon composite job. Very light, very little flex and<em>extremely</em>strong.</p><h4>Engine</h4><p>It’s a 3.8 Litre V6 but that alone isn’t what makes it special, there’s a number of different tricks that turn the otherwise rather mainstream capacity into something altogether more ballistic. The most obvious addition is a couple of turbos, each one feeding into a cylinder bank either side of the longitudinally mounted engine. It all looks a bit like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"GT-R engine bay\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-AXbNNz8x1ys/UeRpJet72fI/AAAAAAAAFe0/DNF4MAPr6Uc/engine011em34.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>You can see it mounted as far back as possible in the engine bay which is another part of the great front-to-rear weight distribution I touched on earlier.</p><p>The bores don’t have cylinder liners, instead they’re plasma coated or more specifically,<a href=\"http://jalopnik.com/5467038/the-ford-engine-technology-good-enough-for-the-nissan-gt+r\">plasma transfer wire arc thermal sprayed</a>. This takes the mass of the traditionally cast iron liners out of the engine.</p><p>Then there’s the turbos:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"555\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Headers and turbos\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Fdbafx6rHhU/UeRpKHbselI/AAAAAAAAFe8/sgpMn1Y9zt0/Turbo%25255B7%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Ordinarily, each of the units you see above would be two separate parts; the turbo (consisting of both the exhaust and intake turbines) and the headers which take emissions from the engine then feed it down usually some distance (depending on the engine packaging) through exhaust plumbing. The GT-R packs the exhaust turbine into the header (you can see it’s one cast unit) so the packaging is smaller and the lag between engine and turbine is reduced.</p><p>Poking around the car shows up all sorts of tricky packaging, cooling and general tricks to extract the levels of performance it achieves, not just for short bursts but for prolonged high performance driving.</p><h4>Instrumentation</h4><p>Here’s the real tech porn bit that’ll resonate with the inner-techie – the multi-function display:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Multi-function device\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-2-r68mfxNHw/UeRpK6qUFtI/AAAAAAAAFfE/k1XJMnM3wlg/Center-display2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is like Task Manager for cars and it can spit out a wealth of information in different formats. Instrumentation in vehicles – even high performance vehicles – is usually limited to things like speed, RPM and a very vague engine temp gauge. In the GT-R, you get stuff like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"MFD lateral g-forces\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-9-vMj-LNjeo/UeRpLtctjQI/AAAAAAAAFfM/UArkaUA4pD4/Multi-function-meters-034.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Longitudinal G forces (i.e. the rate of acceleration) combined with boost pressure (effectively how hard the turbos are working to force air into the engine) and the amount of acceleration potential actually being used. But that’s just the start, you also get stuff like this:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"MFD guages\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-jTjPaPBy6Wk/UeRpMY3NsRI/AAAAAAAAFfU/RCAJ2G7Sl3w/Multi-function-meters-024.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>The distribution of torque from front to rear is especially interesting as it can dramatically change the behaviour of the car. The STi had the ability to shuffle torque backwards and forwards as well but there was always a significant portion going through the front wheels which made it hard to exploit some of the more desirable attributes of a rear wheel drive platform such as power-on oversteer.</p><p>All in all, you get 18 different system metrics that can be represented on the LCD:</p><ol><li>Engine Coolant Temperature</li><li>Engine Oil Temperature</li><li>Engine Oil Pressure</li><li>Transmission Oil Temperature</li><li>Transmission Oil Pressure</li><li>Boost</li><li>Speed</li><li>Fuel/Range</li><li>Fuel Flow</li><li>Recent Fuel Economy</li><li>Torque split</li><li>Accel pedal</li><li>Brake pedal</li><li>Steering angle</li><li>Cornering g-force</li><li>Accel/Braking g-force</li><li>Total g-force</li><li>Clock (yay!)</li></ol><p>The<a href=\"http://www.nissan-techinfo.com/refgh0v/og/gt-r/2013-Nissan-GTR-MFD-Navi.pdf\">manual for the MFD</a>goes on about the various functions and how they can be represented on screen and frankly many of them are not a lot of use. Things like g-forces are kind of neat for geek value, but even on the track you’d go for dedicated instrumentation designed for maximising lap times. Fluid temps, however, really are useful and once you have an accurate oil temp gauge (as I did courtesy of an aftermarket one in the STi), you realise just how long it takes the car (any car, for that matter), to get to a temp where oils are actually at an optimal temp to do their job properly. Many a car has been driven hard too early and suffered rather unpleasant consequences as a result.</p><h4>Aero</h4><p>There are two big problems cars face the faster the go: drag and downforce. Too much of the first seriously dents acceleration (and fuel economy), not enough of the latter makes it harder to go around corners at pace. But the two objectives can also be counter-productive as creating downforce also crates drag. This is one of the reasons why we’re seeing more and more active aerodynamics so the car can be sleek when it needs to but then disrupt the airflow enough to apply downforce to different parts of the vehicle as required (check out<a href=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5231/5898330381_05dd547f82_o.jpg\">the flaps on a Pagani Huayra</a>if you’re not sure what this looks like). But I digress…</p><p>The GT-R focuses primary on drag and as a result has very low drag coefficient of 0.26, about lineball with a Toyota Prius. Against the competition, that’s amazingly efficient: Porsche Turbo is 0.31 (less is better when it comes to drag), a Ferrari California is 0.32 and even a recent model Corvette is 0.29. You’ll get slightly lower than that on some economy-focussed cars (take a few hundredths off) but you need to remember that performance cars are also trying to generate downforce so the previous performance car comparables are the real interesting bits.</p><p>So how does it do it? Aero always comes downs to lots of little tweaks, for example the door handles:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"404\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Door handle\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-SZr9PItKOSA/UeRpM_7tR_I/AAAAAAAAFfc/AwcQkznkTPM/Untitled-62.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Of more significance is the underbody (in fact a huge amount of drag originates under the chassis):</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"359\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Underbody\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-kbGFiuKhgK0/UeRpNiIR3tI/AAAAAAAAFfk/yVtaFGC1nFA/Untitled-13.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>You can see the smooth profile courtesy of scuff plates, a diffuser and other facades that attempt to smooth the airflow by keeping all the pointy bits out of the way. But there’s a whole lot of subtleties that aren’t immediately obvious; I put mine up on the hoist at my mechanic’s last week and found a whole bunch of goodies. For example, the three cooling ducts you can see in the black panels just in front of the rear wheels. That middle one feeds air directly onto the heat sink on the gearbox then passes it out through the duct behind it. There’s also a phenomenal amount of bracing, for example you can just see the vertical bar in front of the two catalytic converters behind the panels under the front of the car. There’s another very significant brace just behind the cats which passes over the exhaust just before the two pipes go into one. Not exactly aero any more but quite interesting whilst we’re looking at the underside.</p><p>Then of course there’s the entire body profile with that classic coupe shape which is always going to play nice with airflow:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"358\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Body aerodynamics\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-A4ljuIGQnCE/UeRpOEXgoXI/AAAAAAAAFfs/Zemuok8CL5s/Untitled-22.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>One thing that’s very unique about the GT-R though is the hard edges on many of the surfaces. You can see it on the trailing edge of the vents just behind the front wheels in the picture above but it’s really evident when you look at the way the sides of the body join the rear of the car:</p><p><img width=\"600\" height=\"503\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Trailing edge of body\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ykWS6hw9XmA/UeRpO5FtLfI/AAAAAAAAFf0/XYLoel9tBHE/Taillights2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>They’re damned near right angles and the lighting in that pic really illustrates just how sharp the lines are. Aesthetically, it doesn’t have the beauty of a curvaceous Porsche 911 but there’s something very functional, very Japanese about the whole design.</p><p>One of the things that really bugs me in automotive design is<em>over</em>-design; features that have no functional value and just appear tacked on for some sort of odd aesthetic value. Think Apple’s skeuomorphic approach (and we all know how that’s ended up). For example, I thoroughly dislike how Subaru has added faux vents to the front and rear bumpers:</p><p><img width=\"400\" height=\"263\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Front fake vent of a Subaru STi\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Mx5EqcOsLQc/UeRpPev-EJI/AAAAAAAAFf8/-E_eCwq2YSc/2009-Subaru-Impreza-Wrx-Sti-A-Line-D%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"> <img width=\"400\" height=\"263\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Rear fake vents of a Subaru WRX\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-wWHErtgEmiE/UeRpP3DWA4I/AAAAAAAAFgE/XQoLOedXOQc/p5.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>You know what these are?<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAPmqX-FyvU\">Speed holes</a>:</p><p><img width=\"532\" height=\"426\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Simpsons speed holes\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-gSN2hu-Aamw/UeRpQSlu_yI/AAAAAAAAFgM/YrN87_ADFXY/O5HtQ2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Living with the GT-R for a little while you start to notice all the aero nuances that don’t really come through in the pictures earlier on, things like the protrusion beneath the wing mirrors (a particularly aerodynamically inefficient piece of equipment):</p><p><img width=\"434\" height=\"326\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Wing mirror aero\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-OXptgNpIlRA/UeRpRHc16lI/AAAAAAAAFgU/bvyLO0Zqauc/nissan_10gtr_mirror_Large2.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Or the subtleties in the rear wing design like the slightly raised ends, streamlined protrusions just above the mounting points or just how far back beyond the boot lid it actually extends:</p><p><img width=\"800\" height=\"334\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Rear spolier\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-9XJy3VDkSMQ/UeRpRxzq6KI/AAAAAAAAFgc/kzfGuOvJZHY/2012-Nissan-GT-R-Egoist-Carbon-Rear-.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Then there’s the vents behind the front wheel arches –<em>real</em>vents – that draw heat from the engine bay through the negative pressure area created behind the contour of the arch:</p><p><img width=\"801\" height=\"500\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Vents behind wheels to draw air from engine bay\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-xUC18lbGbX0/UeRpSQjdK2I/AAAAAAAAFgk/XHsJ90osuUI/Nissan-GTR-052.jpg?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>All of this (and much, much more) adds up to contribute to that low drag coefficient. It’s little pieces like the drag, the transmission and the grip that add up to that massive performance that’s so far beyond what it<em>should</em>be capable of based on power and weight alone. The big question though is:</p><h4>But what’s it like to drive?</h4><p>Violent. Well actually, it’s docile then it’s violent, I mean you can drive it around town in auto with everything in comfort mode and it’s not much different to many mainstream cars. Probably the main compromise is the ride although it’s still comfier than the STi and the ground clearance is only<em>fractionally</em>less. But then you flick the transmission and traction into R, whack the shifter into manual mode and it all goes a bit Millennium-Falcon-in-hyperdrive.</p><p>First gear can’t get all the power down so the traction control has a job managing that before you whack into the rev limiter. Second hits hard as the RPM is already up there so it pulls<em>very</em>strongly into third and that’s about as much as I can, uh, publicly say until it sees a racetrack :)</p><p>What I can say though is that in second the back will still let go if tipped into a corner hard enough and that’s on a bone dry road. The traction control in race mode though gives it a big whack of slip and combined with some opposite lock it pulls it back dead straight (if you’re quick) and just powers on to redline. Probably the biggest surprise actually is just how rear-orientated the power delivery is, in many ways it drives more like the powerful rear wheel drive cars I had before the Subarus. The latter would tend towards understeer and the only way you’re getting out of that is to ease off the throttle while the former would oversteer at the drop of a hat and need to be balanced on the throttle and steering, assuming you weren’t already facing in the wrong direction.</p><p>Again, it’s the computers that nail it in the GT-R. They give you the slip to get tail happy but reign it in at just the right time to not just save you from yourself but to go faster than if they weren’t there. Times gone by (and in many current generation cars), the computers just get in the way behaving in an obtrusive fashion that kills both fun and pace. Top Gear mag summarised the modern day electronic nanny as follows:</p><blockquote><p>These days, you don’t drive around the traction-control systems. You drive straight into them, and go faster</p></blockquote><p>That’s what it feels like in the GT-R – not intrusive at the limit of adhesion (at least not in race mode), rather complimentary in the best way possible in terms of outright speed. Like the WRX though, the grip thresholds are that much higher than your average performance vehicle that when it<em>does</em>let go it can be at a serious rate of knots which means it might not always end well.</p><p>The other thing about the GT-R is the reaction it brings out of others. The day my wife and I got the car we had schoolkids and senior citizens alike come up and talk about it, the latter couple describing how this was their son’s dream car and would be the first purchase after a lotto win before a house (pro tip: invest first then buy toys!) The enthusiasm extends to the road with other cars regularly jostling for the right spot so the driver can unashamedly ogle the black beast. Even kids on bikes the other day were stopping mid-crossing and gawking then giving thumbs up and leaving with big smiles. Whilst I’m sure not all run ins will be positive, most of them pretty much<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=_Ejo-bKC2nY\">go like this</a>and that can really make your day :)</p><p>Speaking of kids, yes, they fit. Frankly that’s one of the most significant things about the car, that it can do everything above<em>and</em>still carry family. It’s not<em>the</em>family car and nor will it ever be, but it can comfortably get away with it when it needs to. On the practicality front, the fuel economy was a bit of a shock – it’s better than the STi by a fair margin and even fractionally less than our R36 VW (the<em>real</em>family car). A week of Sydney traffic commute would normally see the Subaru around 15.5L/100km and the dub dub about 14.5, the GT-R has been running at low 14s which is a rather nice surprise. I suspect it’s a combination of the fact that it gets into high gears quickly and has enough torque to maintain them without constantly shuffling them. It’s a lot more stable than the DSG in the VW in that regard.</p><p>Enough of that, let’s get to the drive video and if you’re just after the windy road bits, flick through to 15:00 with the best sections of road from about 21:00. It’s only public roads and there’s mostly armco on one side and rocks or trees on the other with no run-off (plus the desire to preserve my license!) so until I get to a track it’s going to be a bit restrained. What doesn’t really come through looking at it again now is just how brutal the acceleration is out of corners, that and the smoother you drive the slower it looks so I’ll try and sort out some better camera angles on track.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ejo-bKC2nY?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><p>Apologies for the slight static and for some rather mundane sections, I recorded the audio on iPhone and didn’t realise the mic was rubbing on my shirt then I realised I don’t know what the hell I’m doing in iMovie and cropping things just got too hard. Sorry!</p><h4>Next</h4><p>Where do you go from here? Well firstly, I’ll give it some track time but don’t feel the same itch like I did a decade ago. I’ll probably take it out for some demo runs next driver training day and enjoy it with others. Then there’s always mods – do enough work and they’re<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaYTqAaPD5w&feature=youtu.be\">significantly outpacing a Bugatti Veyron Supersport</a>. We don’t really have either the roads or motorsport events down here to take advantage of that sort of behaviour but the classic exhaust and tune may feature later on.</p><p>But for the most part, it’s now just about enjoying the machine, reflecting on the path that has taken us here and trying to get out of the city more to actually enjoy it. Oh – and sharing the experience with friends. So who’s coming for a ride? :)</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/hjQnxQG9oe0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":434}}

Gorgeous and functional software is why Mac companies like<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~panic.com/transmit/\">Panic</a>exist.

If you're familiar with Windows 7 you are likely familiar with the way that progress bars are overlaid over a Windows 7 Taskbar button.

and wrote a<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.cognitiveinheritance.com/post/Using-Target-Specific-Code-in-a-Portable-Library.aspx\">blog post</a>about how you can do this with abstraction and (preferably) dependency injection.<blockquote><p>On at least 2 occasions recently, I have heard speakers tell their audience that you cannot reference a target-specific .NET library (such as a .NET Framework 4.5 library) from a Portable Class Library. While this is technically true, it doesn't tell nearly the whole story. Even though we can't reference target-specific libraries, we can still USE these libraries. We can call their methods and access their properties under the right circumstances. We can gain access to these libraries via an abstraction. My preferred method of doing this is...Dependency Injection.</p></blockquote><h3>Cross Platform .NET Coolness</h3><p>There's lots of great examples of code reuse,<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.hanselminutes.com/343/draw-a-stickman-epic-an-iphone-android-and-windows-8-game-with-monogame\">like the podcast I did with the folks who wrote\"Draw a Stickman EPIC.\"</a>This app has 95%+ code reuse, all written in C# and is available in every App Store there is.

If you're using RavenDB, or NHibernate, or SignalR or whatever, you can get introspection into what's going on in a Glimpse Tab.</p><blockquote><p>You turn Glimpse on and off with cookies, and you can setup security policy however you want. Glimpse isn't in the background creeping around - you have absolute control over when you want it used.

I didn't have to change any part of my code or do anything more than just install Glimpse.

And this time I ended up so pissed after an interview I had to call a sick colleague just to vent.</p><p>One candidate I ruled out early during the interview process. It was a somewhat sinking sensation in the pit of my stomach as I spoke with the candidate, and I couldn’t get a single actually<em>technical</em>description about what the candidate is actually doing now. A lot of broad descriptions, and a lot of sweeping statements, but no real technical details. But the candidate did know jQuery mobile back& forth, it appears.</p><p>The decision was made final when I asked the candidate what web framework they were using. I asked whatever they were using ASP.NET WebForms, ASP.NET MVC or ASP.Net Web API. Note that from my perspective, it is a list in a ascending worth order, and you you are using something not on it, that is a plus (it means you aren’t just using whatever is available, which is nice). So I was quite excited when the candidate said (confusedly) “none of them”. Then it took me putting on my investigative hat and asking a lot of questions about how they are actually doing things before it finally came out that they were doing ASPX.</p><p>Not knowing the<em>name</em>of the environment in which you are working with for the past several years… I am not sure what to call it.</p><p>At least the candidate was able to let me know how they were using that in great detail. We do stuff in Page_Init, then we have  a method that load the data from the database and put it in the ViewState or the Session, then we bind it to a grid, and most of the code is in the grid event handlers. I am sure that the candidate is a great web developer, but I would rather that this particular candidate be great at another location.</p><p>The second candidate actually passed our phone screen and was invited to an interview. We have a fairly basic interview process. Some background information for both sides, then a few questions that you need to solve in Visual Studio (and yes, you have full MSDN& Google access) and then a technical portion of the interview that include a system design and a more detailed set of technical knowledge questions.</p><p>Now, I am sure that you have heard about interesting interview questions like sort a 100 GB file in a machine 32 bits with 512MB of memory. I admit that something like that would be challenging and interesting. I would probably quite enjoy seeing how people deal with that.</p><p>That is not the type of questions that we ask. I asked for a “sort these strings” and a “calculate this tax” programs. I gave the candidate about an hour and a half, alone in a room with VS and internet connection. I am not even asking to implement your own sort, just customize the comparison function and run the standard .NET sort. And do some basic math. The candidate was unable to finish either problem on the time allotted. Now, to be fair for the candidate, the way he solved the first problem was correct and much better than many other attempts that I have seen. Note that the issue was an IComparable&lt;string&gt; instead of IComparable&lt;Item&gt; that caused the issue. It is subtle and something that I would expect an newbie to catch. But this candidate came with full 6 years of experience.</p><p>Okay, I said to myself, it is natural to be nervous when doing interviews, let us see what the candidate knows beyond that. The CV mentioned that work with mutli threading. So I began with some questions about that. But it appears that “I only know Thread and BackgroundWorker”. But the absolute clincher was when I asked the candidate about what would cause a high CPU problem and how to diagnose that: “Well, I think that there are special tools that will tell you which process is using the CPU…”</p><p><em>Special</em>tools? Well, I guess Task Manager can be called special, but I am not really sure that I would call it that .And if your experience in troubleshooting stuff never go to the point where you actually look at Task Manager to see what is going on… it probably means that you don’t<em>have</em>meaningful experience in actually troubleshooting stuff.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/fSwUw1RF6qw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":598}}

At first I was doubting between Scala, Ruby or perhaps Clojure. But I couldn’t really make up my mind. So I decided to pick up <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/193435659X/elegantcode-20\" target=\"_blank\">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>. This way I was able to take a small bite from a couple different cakes in order to decide which flavor I liked the most. </p><p align=\"justify\">The seven languages that are discussed  in this book are Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure and Haskell. </p><p align=\"justify\">I really liked Ruby and it’s nice syntax as this programming language is not a complete stranger to me. </p><p align=\"justify\">I had great hopes for Scala, but it kind of left me disappointed. While exploring the syntax of this academic newcomer, I had this constant nagging feeling that Scala reminded me too much of C++. Don’t get me wrong, I do like C++. But while C++ was intended to bridge the gap between procedural programming (C) and object-oriented programming, Scala does seem to bring the same kind of awkwardness as it tries to bridge the gap between object-oriented programming and functional programming. I still find it a really fascinating language to learn, but it kind of fell down in my personal ranking.</p><p align=\"justify\">The big surprise for me was Erlang. Although it’s syntax has its quirks, this is a truly powerful and fascinating programming language that piqued my interest. </p><p align=\"justify\">Clojure was kind of was I expected and brought back some fine memories from the small, entry-level Lisp programs I wrote back when I was in college.</p><p align=\"justify\">While I was reading this book, I briefly jumped into some other programming languages as well. Go, D and yes, even Smalltalk are other programming languages that sparked my interest. </p><p align=\"justify\">I very much enjoyed reading this book and had a lot of fun trying to do those small exercises at the end of each day. The only down-side now is that the list of programming languages that I want to take a closer look at basically doubled. Oh well, nothing that flipping a coin can’t handle.</p><p align=\"justify\">I want to end this blog post with the question: What programming language are you learning at the moment?</p><p align=\"justify\">Until next time.</p>","author":"Jan Van Ryswyck","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":670}}

This is an opportunity for all DevDiv interns to work with the breadth of Microsoft technologies to create something cool. Anything, really.</p><p>And the individual teams get to keep the IP for whatever they make during the event! We may be about to launch some startups this week. How cool is that?</p><p>During the 48 hour event, which takes place Wednesday and Thursday of this week (July 31-Aug 1), self-organized teams are provided any resource they might need to create whatever software they can imagine. This year’ participants will have incredibly hopped up laptops, Surfaces, Windows Phones, Azure credits, Kinects, SDKs galore, late-breaking bits Visual Studio, and a cadre of deeply knowledgeable technical wizards as advisors.</p><p>The down side is that the event is being held a little off the main campus, which means that some of the Microsofties who might otherwise have wandered over to check out the final projects may elect to stay home. That would be a shame. I am very confident these students are going to teach us some things about getting solutions done and delivered. The technologies and levels of abstraction at which these students work is just different than in previous generations. Today’s up-and-coming developers are delivering more value, with less code, in shorter cycles than ever before possible.</p><p>Final demonstrations of solutions will be Thursday afternoon in a giant science-fair format. If you a ‘softie, get yourself over to the Bravern 2 building in Bellevue Thursday afternoon between 2:00 and 4:30. All the projects will be set up at review booths and I guarantee you will learn something from the new generation.</p>","author":"David Starr","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1154}}

The salesman had snagged a new client by promising that all of their data from their current application could be trivially imported into Daan's company's primary product -<i>no problem-o!</i>Unfortunately, the salesman had not bothered to ask the new customer what the data looked like. Or in what format it existed. Or how much of it was there. Or if it was in any way consistent. He had just made the promise. Now it was their problem to make it all work. Unfortunately for Daan, he had been<del>victimized</del>assigned with the task of making the magic happen.</p><p>First, the data was delivered as a plethora of Excel spreadsheets, each one representing a table in the client database. Perhaps job-one should be to dump it all into scratch tables and try to work from there.</p><p>After some casual perusal, Daan discovered that every record had two unique keys:<i>recordId</i>and [<i>Name Of The Table</i>]<i>Id</i>. Ok, it could be worse. Then he discovered the crown jewel of the database; the<i>Child</i>table:<blockquote><pre><b>Column Name         Comment</b>dateOfBirth         timestamp in the form of msmonthOfBirth        full name of the month of birthage                 varchar2<span style='color:#808030; '>(</span><span style='color:#008c00; '>64</span><span style='color:#808030; '>)</span><span style='color:#808030; '>:</span>contains things like<span style='color:#808030; '>:</span><span style='color:#800000; '>\"</span><span style='color:#0000e6; '>The child is now 16 months old</span><span style='color:#800000; '>\"</span>nursery1            namenursery2            namenursery3            namenursery4            nameaddressNursery1     addressaddressNursery2     addressaddressNursery3     addressaddressNursery4     addresscontractYesNo       e<span style='color:#008c00; '>.</span>g<span style='color:#808030; '>.</span><span style='color:#808030; '>:</span><span style='color:#800000; '>\"</span><span style='color:#0000e6; '>Not yet</span><span style='color:#800000; '>\"</span><span style='color:#808030; '>,</span><span style='color:#800000; '>\"</span><span style='color:#0000e6; '>Not made</span><span style='color:#800000; '>\"</span><span style='color:#808030; '>,</span><span style='color:#800000; '>\"</span><span style='color:#0000e6; '>Signed+returned</span><span style='color:#800000; '>\"</span><span style='color:#808030; '>,</span><span style='color:#800000; '>\"</span><span style='color:#0000e6; '>FILE_NOT_FOUND</span><span style='color:#800000; '>\"</span></pre></blockquote><p>Daan couldn't tell which was worse; what horror would be required to keep the<i>age</i>field current, what would happen if a 5th nursery was required, why the apparently unrelated Nursery table even existed, or what purpose the duplicate unique keys served.

Roughly two people noticed its absence, until the other day when a paragraph in Private Eye claimed I'd asked Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, to switch off the reader comments underneath my articles (not true), and that he'd refused to do so (also not true), so I'd quit (not entirely true). This led to an intense flurry of activity, by which I mean four people asked me about it.</p><p>Although the Private Eye story wasn't completely wrong – I have stopped doing this particular column for a while, for reasons I'll explain in a moment – I was all set to write to their letters page to whine in the most pompous manner imaginable, something I've always secretly wanted to do, when I figured I might as well respond here instead, for money.</p><p>Incidentally, I'm aware this is Olympic-level navel gazing, but you're a human being with free will who can stop reading any time. Here, have a full stop. And another. And another. There are exits all over this building.</p><p>Anyway, I haven't quit the newspaper, but I have, for the meantime, stopped writing weekly, partly because my overall workload was making that kind of timetable impossible, and partly because I've recently been overwhelmed by the sheer amount of jabber in the world: a vast cloud of blah I felt I was contributing to every seven days.</p><p>If a weatherman misreads the national mood and cheerfully sieg-heils on BBC Breakfast at 8.45am, there'll be 86 outraged columns, 95 despairing blogs, half a million wry tweets and a rib-tickling pass-the-parcel Photoshop meme about it circulating by lunchtime. It happens every day. Every day, a billion instantly conjured words on any contemporaneous subject you can think of. Events and noise, events and noise; everything was starting to resemble nothing but events and noise. Firing more words into the middle of all that began to strike me as futile and unnecessary. I started to view myself as yet another factory mindlessly pumping carbon dioxide into a toxic sky.</p><p>This is perhaps not the ideal state of mind for someone writing a weekly column in a newspaper. Clearly it was time for a short break.</p><p>Reader comments form part of the overall wordstorm described above, and it's true I'm not a huge fan of them, but that's chiefly because I'm an elderly man from the age of steam who clings irrationally to the outmoded belief that articles and letters pages should be kept separate, just like church and state. I guess conceptually I still think I'm writing in a \"newspaper\", even though the reality of what that means has changed beyond measure since I started doing it. So now I'm sitting grumpily in a spaceship with my arms folded, wearing a stovepipe hat. Ridiculous.</p><p>These days most newspaper sites are geared towards encouraging interaction with the minuscule fraction of readers who bother to interact back, which is a pity because I'm selfishly uninterested in conducting any kind of meaningful dialogue with humankind in general. I'd say Twitter's better for back-and-forth discussion anyway, if you could be arsed with it. Yelling out the window at passersby is another option.</p><p>When it comes to comments, despite not being as funny as I never was in the first place, I get an incredibly easy ride from passing wellwishers compared with any woman who dares write anything on the internet anywhere about anything at all, the ugly bitch, boo, go home bitch go home. Getting slagged off online is par for the course, and absorbing the odd bit of constructive criticism is character-building. The positive comments are more unsettling. Who needs to see typed applause accompanying an article? It's just weird. I don't get it.</p><p>But then right now I don't \"get\" most forms of communication. There's just so much of it. Everybody talking at once and all over each other; everyone on the planet typing words into their computers, for ever, like I'm doing now. I fail to see the point of roughly 98% of human communication at the moment, which indicates I need to stroll around somewhere quiet for a bit.</p><p>After my break, and a rethink, I'll quietly return later in the year, to write something slightly different, slightly less regularly (probably fortnightly). In other words, I'm reducing my carbon emissions. And whatever the new thing I'm writing turns out to be, it'll appear both online, still accompanied by the requisite string of comments, and in the newspaper, which is a foldable thing made of paper, containing words and pictures, which catches fire easily and is sometimes left on trains.</p><p>Now get out.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/digital-media\">Digital media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newspapers\">Newspapers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pressandpublishing\">Newspapers&magazines</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/social-media\">Social media</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charliebrooker\">Charlie Brooker</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\">© 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

My primary beef with the X1 Carbon is its screen resolution, a barely passable 1400x900, but everything else (plus it's just over 3 pound weight) keeps me using it. However, I get about 5-6 hours typing on the X1 but about 4 hours of\"hard work\"which just isn't enough considering I'd like to sit AWAY from an electrical outlet for once. If the X1 Carbon Touch had a better 1080p (or better) screen and Haswell, it could be the perfect PC. But do I really need Haswell?</p><p><img title=\"All Ultrabooks are Thin Now\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"All Ultrabooks are Thin Now\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/2ebcb793d37e_145FA/IMG_6793_1.jpg\"width=\"750\"height=\"463\"></p><p>From The Verge, Intel has made some<strong>bold</strong>statements regarding the Haswell generation:</p><blockquote><p>Intel's been branding the new processor tech as its\"largest generational leap ever\"with\"<strong>the biggest performance improvement ever in battery life,</strong>\"as Intel's executive VP of sales and marketing Tom Kilroy boldly stated at Computex's opening keynote speech.

It's a reference hardware example, as it were. I'm not looking to review it as the Ultimate Haswell Laptop, rather as an example Ultrabook with the characteristics I would hope to see in other vendor's Haswell systems.</p><p>I will do an in depth review after a month or so of using this, but here's my initial impressions after using this Haswell Laptop exclusively for two full days of actual work.</p><h3>Size/Weight</h3><p>Three pounds, baby. That's the standard for nice laptops now. If it's five pounds, it's too heavy. This is a lovely size and a lovely weight. The best part about this Ultrabook is that it's 3.5 lbs and it has a 1080p screen. YES! That's almost enough for me to start using it full time over the Lenovo Carbon X1 Touch. Air-sized is the new size. If it's not this size then I'm not interested in it.</p><h3>Look/Feel</h3><p>While this is a prototype that will never be produce, it is definitely<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.hanselman.com/blog/InitialImpressionsOfThe3rdGenerationIvyBridgeIntelUltrabookReferenceHardwareForDevelopersOnWindows8.aspx\">nicer than the Ivy Bridge</a>I looked at last year. That one had a lousy keyboard and a nightmare trackpad that has since broken. (My wife can no longer\"left click\"with that Intel Prototype.<strong>This</strong>Haswell 4th gen has stepped up the casing part of the hardware, at least, considerably. Remembering that the insides are presumably what this device is aiming to showcase, regardless, the touch pad on this device is WAY better than my X1 (whose<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.hanselman.com/blog/ReviewTheLenovoX1CarbonTouchIsMyNewLaptop.aspx\">touchpad I despise with the heat of a thousand suns</a>) and the keyboard, while it doesn't have Lenovo's legendary quality throw, is still comfortable and fast.</p><p>This machine is a matte, almost gunmetal black, with light but firm plastic housing. The major fail is the weak/flimsy power connector, but that's a small complaint. I would also have preferred dedicated page up/down buttons. Otherwise, it's a pleasant and appealing housing.</p><h3>Specs/Performance</h3><p>Setting this machine up from initial boot to a usable machine including Office 2013, Visual Studio 2013 and Windows 8.1 to just 5 hours, working at night watching TV. Mostly it was\"next, next, next, finish\"as the hard drive light blinked. Part of this is due to the speed of the machine, and part of it is due to newly re-written setup programs. With Office 2013's Click To Run I had Word running in 10 minutes, and VS2013 Pro Preview running in 30. Windows 8.1 took a few hours, and the rest of my developer tools were installed with<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.hanselman.com/blog/IsTheWindowsUserReadyForAptget.aspx\">Chocalatey</a>(<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.hanselman.com/blog/IsTheWindowsUserReadyForAptget.aspx\">apt-get for Windows</a>).</p><p>While I wasn't initially impressed with this Ultrabook having only 4 gigs of RAM and an i5 processor (Id'have preferred 8 gigs and an i7), I really haven't noticed a speed difference (yet) against my 3rd-gen i7 Lenovo X1 Carbon. I will do more profiling later to understand the characteristics of this machine and how it affects compilation and app debugging performance.</p><h3>Battery Life</h3><p>I have mixed feelings about this. I think the hype machine has us all in its grips. I keep hearing\"12 hour battery life\"and\"all day battery life.\"But of course I realize that intellectually this means\"lower the brightness and watch a movie that has the GPU do all the work and don't touch the laptop all day battery life.\"It's not\"work really hard and compile and run VMs and Outlook and Visual Studio\"battery life.</p><p>That said, I worked for 6.5 hours before the battery died. It wasn't 12, and it wasn't 10. It was nearly 7 and the brightness was at about 70%. I'm going to wait a bit and do some more formal benchmark. Yes, it's 50% more battery life than the pathetic 4 hours I get now, but it's not all day. Still, the hype machine. I am withholding judgment because it's clearly BETTER, and it's just been a few days.</p><p><hr><p><strong>Disclosure of Material Connection:</strong>Intel sent me this Haswell Ultrabook in the hope that I would review it on my blog.

And I am currently tracking through the process in which we add a new item to the database. The first thing that happen is that we allocate a leaf page. I think that I’ll have to go over how pages are allocated now, which should explain a lot about how LMDB reuses disk space.</p><p>A new page is allocated by first finding the oldest transaction that is still active. This is how LMDB implements MVCC. Basically, any free page that is older than any existing transaction is eligible for reuse. The first db (although a better term would be to call it btree, or maybe a table) contains the free pages, and at first we search there for an available page. If we can’t find such a page, we use the end of the file for that. This happens in mdb_page_alloc.</p><p>An very interesting aspect is the fact that LMDB allows direct memory writes (with the additional risk of corrupting the db if you messed the data), interestingly, this is done in the following code:</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_4ECB/image_2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_4ECB/image_thumb.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"139\"></a></p><p>If the options allows directly memory writes, you get a point to the mmap file. Otherwise, LMDB will allocate a page (or re-use one that has already been allocated).</p><p>I am not really sure what is going on with the insert yet. This is a function pointer (delegate for C#). And it select which behavior will happen later on. I am just not sure what those two different function do yet.</p><p>I think I got it, the key is here:</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_4ECB/image_4.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_4ECB/image_thumb_1.png\" width=\"268\" height=\"95\"></a></p><p>You can see that we use the insert method to add the mid variable to the dirty list. So if we give you a direct pointer, we append it to the list. But if we give you allocate a page, we need to add it in order.</p><p>The mdb_mid2l_insert will add an item to the list in the appropriate location to ensure sorting. I<em>think</em>that this is done so when we actually write the dirty page to disk, if we do that using file I/O, we will do that in ascending file order, so we can get good seek times from the disk. A new page has 4,084 bytes available for it (12 bytes are taken by header data).</p><p>A database is actually created the first time data is written to it. The root page is allocated and recorded. And then the data is added to the page.</p><p>As you might recall, data inside a page is kept in a sorted list. But remember that the data is also stored on the page, and there is the whole notion of overflow pages, so I think that I am going to have to draw a picture to figure out what is going on.</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_4ECB/image_8.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_4ECB/image_thumb_3.png\" width=\"340\" height=\"372\"></a></p><p>This is more or less how it works. But I don’t think that I really get it. Note that there are two collections here. First is the positions of nodes in the page, and the second is the node themselves. The reason we have this complexity is that we need to maintain both of them in an efficient manner. And we need to do that without too much copying. Therefor, the list of nodes in the page is in the beginning, growing downward, and the actual nodes are in the end, growing upward. The page is full when you can’t fit anything between those two lists.</p><p>A node, by the way, is the LMDB internal name for a key (and maybe data). But I think that I might have an error here, because I don’t<em>see</em>the code here to actually add nodes to the page in a sorted fashion, so it might be doing linear search on the content of a node. I am not tracking through the code for adding a second value into a database. And I think that I have to be wrong about linear node search. The code I was looking at was invoked at the the new db creation section, so it might be taking shortcuts that aren’t generally available.</p><p>At any rate, the logic for adding an item goes like this… first we need to find the appropriate page. And we do this by starting from the root and asking for the actual page. Which gets us to mdb_page_get, where we have the following:</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_4ECB/image_10.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_4ECB/image_thumb_4.png\" width=\"531\" height=\"481\"></a></p><p>The really interesting part here is that each transaction have a dirty list of pages, so if you modified a page, you’ll get your own version, even before the data was committed. Otherwise, we will just hand you the current version. This is<em>quite</em>nice.</p><p>And then we get to the already familiar mdb_page_search_root function, and I can confirm that the nodes in a page<em>are</em>actually sorted, which only make sense. I am not sure where that happens yet, but I have got the feeling that I am going to see that in a bit.</p><p>Okay, I am going to go on a bit of a rant here, mostly against C, to be honest.</p><p><a href=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_4ECB/image_12.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Reviewing-Lightning-memory-mapped-databa_4ECB/image_thumb_5.png\" width=\"267\" height=\"119\"></a></p><p>Take a look at this code. mdb_page_search does something, but what it does it mutate the state for the cursor (mc), and you are then going to access the mc-&gt;mc_pg[mc-&gt;mc_top] to get the actual result you wanted. To make things more interesting, the is also a mc-&gt;mc_ki, which is the<em>index</em>of the node inside the node. And it drove me crazy, because I just couldn’t see the association between those three values, especially because I am so<em>not</em>used to this type of code that I never even considered this as a possibility.</p><p>At any rate, now I know how it gets to insert things in the right order. When doing mdb_page_search, it calls to mdb_node_search, which does the appropriate setup to tell the next call where it need to actually do the insert to get things in a sorted fashion. I am currently in the mdb_cursor_put, which is trice cursed and really hard to follow. A 400+ lines method with gotos galore.</p><p>But I am in the section where we are actually going to be writing a new value. (new_sub: goto header, if you care). And the code is pretty straight forward from there.</p><p>Next up, I want to see how it handles a page split, but that is a subject to another post.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/00ktps6gCFM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1485}}

One little injection risk in one little feature is often all it takes to disclose every piece of data in the whole system – and I’m going to show you how to do this yourself using a raft of different techniques.</p><p>I demonstrated how to protect against SQLi a couple of years back when I wrote about<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2010/05/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-1.html\">the OWASP Top 10 for .NET developers</a>so I’m not going to focus on mitigation here, this is all about exploiting. But enough of the boring defending stuff, let’s go break things!</p><a name='more'></a><h4>All your datas are belong to us (if we can break out of the query context)</h4><p>Let’s do a quick recap on what it is that makes SQLi possible. In a nutshell, it’s about breaking out of the<em>data</em>context and entering the<em>query</em>context. Let me visualise this for you; say you have URL that includes a query string parameter such as “id=1” and that parameter makes its way down into a SQL query such as this:</p><p align=\"left\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"103\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"SELECT * FROM Widget WHERE ID = 1\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-v8wf12yBReA/Ufd7GKiDAwI/AAAAAAAAFik/h1aZURZ2j7Q/Untitled-12.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>The entire URL probably looked something like this:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"110\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"http://widgetshop.com/Widget/?id=1\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-yJGNQFXQ8Jg/Ufd7Gs6hNPI/AAAAAAAAFis/EMvlU6I2FuQ/Untitled-22.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Pretty basic stuff, where it starts to get interesting is when you can manipulate the data in the URL such that it changes the value passed to the query. Ok, changing “1” to “2” will give you a different widget and that’s to be expected, but what if you did this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=1 or 1=1</font></u></p><p>That might then persist through to the database server like so:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">SELECT</span><span style=\"color: gray\">*</span><span style=\"color: blue\">FROM</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Widget</span><span style=\"color: blue\">WHERE</span><span style=\"color: teal\">ID</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">OR</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">=</span>1</pre><p>What this tells us is that the data is not being sanitised – in the examples above the ID should clearly be an integer yet the value “1 OR 1=1” has been accepted. More importantly though, because this data has simply been appended to the query<em>it has been able to change the function of the statement</em>. Rather than just selecting a single record, this query will now select<em>all</em>records as the “1=1” statement will always be true. Alternatively, we could force the page to return<em>no</em>records by changing “or 1=1” to “and 1=2” as it will always be false hence no results. Between these two alternatives we can easily assess if the app is at risk of an injection attack.</p><p>This is the essence of SQL injection – manipulating query execution with untrusted data – and it happens when developers do things like this:</p><p><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">query =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">\"SELECT * FROM Widget WHERE ID = \"</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">+ Request.QueryString[</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">\"ID\"</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">];<br></span><span style=\"background: white; color: green\">// Execute the query...</span></p><p>Of course what they should be doing is parameterising the untrusted data but I’m not going to go into that here (refer back to<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2010/05/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-1.html\">part one of my OWASP series</a>for more info on mitigation), instead I want to talk more about exploiting SQLi.</p><p>Ok, so that background covers how to demonstrate that a risk is present, but what can you now do with it? Let’s start exploring some common injection patterns.</p><h4>Joining the dots: Union query-based injection</h4><p>Let’s take an example where we expect a set of records to be returned to the page, in this case it’s a list of widgets of “TypeId” 1 on a URL like this:</p><p><font color=\"#0000ff\"><u>http://widgetshop.com/Widgets/?TypeId=1</u></font></p><p>The result on the page then looks like so:</p><p><img width=\"68\" height=\"117\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"3 widgets returned to the page\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-g7i0u59D7lE/Ufd7HFnj82I/AAAAAAAAFi0/GcgJwfnJYIQ/image6.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>We’d expect that query to look something like this once it hits the database:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">SELECT</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Name</span><span style=\"color: blue\">FROM</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Widget</span><span style=\"color: blue\">WHERE</span><span style=\"color: teal\">TypeId</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span>1</pre><p>But if we can apply what I’ve outlined above, namely that we might be able to just append SQL to the data in the query string, we might be able to do something like this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widgets/?TypeId=1 union all select name from sysobjects where xtype='u'</font></u></p><p>Which would then create a SQL query like so:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">SELECT</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Name</span><span style=\"color: blue\">FROM</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Widget</span><span style=\"color: blue\">WHERE</span><span style=\"color: teal\">TypeId</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span>1<span style=\"color: blue\">union</span><span style=\"color: gray\">all</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select</span><span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">xtype</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: red\">'u'</span></pre><p>Now keep in mind that the sysobjects table is the one that lists all the objects in the database and in this case we’re filtering that list by xtype “u” or in other words, user tables. When an injection risk is present that would mean the following output:</p><p><img width=\"66\" height=\"187\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"3 widgets returned to the page followed by 2 internal table names\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-A6YoNxkRaqc/Ufd7HrZDOXI/AAAAAAAAFi8/GfPVE2fE21E/image9.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is what’s referred to as a union query-based injection attack as we’ve simply appended an additional result set to the original and its made its way out directly into the HTML output – easy! Now that we know there’s a table called “User” we could do something like this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widgets/?TypeId=1 union all select password from [user]</font></u></p><p>SQL Server gets a bit uppity if the table name of “user” is not enclosed in square brackets given the word has other meanings in the DB sense. Regardless, here’s what that gives us:</p><p><img width=\"89\" height=\"148\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"3 widgets returned to the page followed by a password\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-vJk-tgqAQpg/Ufd7IFPK7lI/AAAAAAAAFjE/uhgNNX-YgWY/image2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Of course the UNION ALL statement only works when the first SELECT statement has the same number of columns as the second. That’s easily discoverable though, you just try going with a bit of ”union all select ‘a’” then if that fails “union all select ‘a’, ‘b’” and so on. Basically you’re just guessing the number of columns until things work.</p><p>We could go on and on down this path and pull back all sorts of other data, let’s move on to the next attack though. There are times when a union-based attack isn’t going to play ball either due to sanitisation of the input or how the data is appended to the query or even how the result set is displayed to the page. To get around that we’re going to need to get a bit more creative.</p><h4>Making the app squeal: Error-based injection</h4><p>Let’s try another pattern – what if we did this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=1 or x=1</font></u></p><p>Hang on, that’s not valid SQL syntax, the “x=1” piece won’t compute, at least not unless there’s a column called “x” so won’t it just throw an exception? Precisely, in fact it means you’ll see an exception like this:</p><p><img width=\"845\" height=\"187\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Invalid column name 'x'\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-iSzrFMeO-dw/Ufd7InmwlzI/AAAAAAAAFjM/u-o_hoEoAuM/image14.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This an ASP.NET error and other frameworks have similar paradigms but the important thing is that the error message is disclosing information about the internal implementation, namely that there is no column called “x”. Why is this important? It’s fundamentally important because once you establish that an app is leaking SQL exceptions, you can do things like this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=convert(int,(select top 1 name from sysobjects where id=(select top 1 id from (select top 1 id from sysobjects where xtype='u' order by id) sq order by id DESC)))</font></u></p><p>That’s a lot to absorb and I’ll come back to it in more detail, the important thing is though that it will yield this result in the browser:<p><img width=\"844\" height=\"184\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'Widget' to data type int.\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-mM4agaXM6Cg/Ufd7JQvO_fI/AAAAAAAAFjU/tmIarbT7t_w/image17.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>And there we have it, we’ve now discovered that there is a table in the database called “Widget”. You’ll often see this referred to as “Error-based SQL injection” due to the dependency on internal errors. Let’s deconstruct the query from the URL:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: magenta\">convert</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">int</span><span style=\"color: gray\">, (</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">xtype</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: red\">'u'</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: teal\">sq</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">DESC</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)))</span></pre><p>Working from the deepest nesting up, get the first record ID from the sysobjects table after ordering by ID. From that collection, get the<em>last</em>ID (this is why it orders in descending) and pass that into the top select statement. That top statement is then only going to take the table name<em>and try to convert it to an integer</em>. The conversion to integer will almost certainly fail (please people, don’t name your tables “1” or “2” or any other integer for that matter!) and that exception then discloses the table name in the UI.</p><p>Why three select statements? Because it means we can go into that innermost one and change “top 1” to “top 2” which then gives us this result:</p><p><img width=\"844\" height=\"185\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'User' to data type int.\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-GJZJi34IK1Q/Ufd7J5OtHmI/AAAAAAAAFjc/XnioL8T3rvo/image20.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Now we know that there’s a table called “User” in the database. Using this approach we can discover all the column names of each table (just apply the same logic to the syscolumns table). We can then extend that logic even further to select data from table columns:</p><p><img width=\"844\" height=\"184\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'P@ssw0rd' to data type int.\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-QDCJLdU038g/Ufd7KXKELeI/AAAAAAAAFjk/XwdEg1W2yyI/image26.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>In the screen above, I’d already been able to discover that there was a table called “User” and a column called “Password”, all I needed to do was select out of that table (and again, you can enumerate through all records one by one with nested select statements), and cause an exception by attempting to convert the string to an int (you can always append an alpha char to the data if it<em>really is</em>an int then attempt to convert the whole lot to an int which will cause an exception). If you want to get a sense of just how easy this can be, I recorded a<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/10/hacking-is-childs-play-sql-injection.html\">little video last year where I teach my 3 year old to automate this with Havij</a>which uses the technique.</p><p>But there’s a problem with all this – it was only possible because the app was a bit naughty and exposed internal error messages to the general public. In fact the app quite literally<em>told us</em>the names of the tables and columns and then disclosed the data when we asked the right questions, but what happens when it doesn’t? I mean what happens when the app is correctly configured so as not to leak the details of internal exceptions?</p><p>This is where we get into “blind” SQL injection which is the genuinely interesting stuff.</p><h4>Hacking blind</h4><p>In the examples above (and indeed in many precedents of successful injection attacks), the attacks are dependent on the vulnerable app explicitly disclosing internal details either by joining tables and returning the data to the UI or by raising exceptions that bubble up to the browser. Leaking of internal implementations is always a bad thing and as you saw earlier, security misconfigurations such as this can be leveraged to disclose more than just the application structure, you can actually pull<em>data</em>out through this channel as well.</p><p>A correctly configured app<em>should</em>return a message more akin to this one here when an<em>unhandled</em>exception occurs:</p><p><img width=\"845\" height=\"255\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Error. An error occurred while processing your request.\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-IN_JPtT0ZVc/Ufd7Ky6aXZI/AAAAAAAAFjs/cKXM5z4S7SQ/image29.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is the default error page from a brand new ASP.NET app with custom errors configured but again, similar paradigms exist in other technology stacks. Now this page is exactly the same as the earlier ones that showed the internal SQL exceptions but rather than letting them bubble up to the UI they’re being hidden and a friendly error message shown instead. Assuming we also couldn’t exploit a union-based attack, the SQLi risk is entirely gone, right? Not quite…</p><p>Blind SQLi relies on us getting a lot more<em>implicit</em>or in other words, drawing our conclusions based on other observations we can make about the behaviour of the app that aren’t quite as direct as telling us table names or showing column data directly in the browser by way of unions or unhandled exceptions. Of course this now begs the question – how can we make the app behave in an observable fashion such that it discloses the information we had earlier without explicitly telling us?</p><p>We’re going to look at two approaches here: boolean-based and time-based.</p><h4>Ask, and you shall be told: Boolean-based injection</h4><p>This all comes down to asking the right questions of the app. Earlier on, we could explicitly ask questions such as “What tables do you have” or “What columns do you have in each table” and the database would explicitly tell us. Now we need to ask a little bit differently, for example like this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=1 and 1=2</font></u></p><p>Clearly this equivalency test can never be true – one will never be equal to two. How an app at risk of injection responds to this request is the cornerstone of blind SQLi and it can happen in one of two different ways.</p><p>Firstly, it might just throw an exception if no record is returned. Often developers will<em>assume</em>that a record referred to in a query string exists because it’s usually the app itself that has provided the link based on pulling it out of the database on another page. When there’s no record returned, things break. Secondly, the app<em>might not</em>throw an exception but then it also won’t display a record either because the equivalency is false. Either way, the app is implicitly telling us that no records were returned from the database.</p><p>Now let’s try this:</p><pre class=\"code\">1<span style=\"color: gray\">and(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: magenta\">substring</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">xtype</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: red\">'u'</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: teal\">sq</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">desc</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)) =</span><span style=\"color: red\">'a'</span></pre><p>Keeping in mind that this entire block replaces<em>just the query string value</em>so instead of “?id=1” it becomes “?id=1 and…”, it’s actually only a minor variation on the earlier requests intended to retrieve table names. In fact the main different is that rather than attempting to cause an exception by converting a string to an integer, it’s now an equivalency test to see if the first character of the table name is an “a” (we’re assuming a case-insensitive collation here). If this request gives us the same result as “?id=1” then it confirms that the first table in sysobjects does indeed begin with an “a” as the equivalency has held true. If it gives us one of the earlier mentioned two scenarios (an error or shows no record), then we know that the table<em>doesn’t</em>begin with an “a” as no record has been returned.</p><p>Now all of that only gives us the first character of the table name from sysobjects, when you want the second character then the substring statement needs to progress to the next position:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: magenta\">substring</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>2<span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=(</span></pre><p>You can see it now starts at position 2 rather than position 1. Of course this is laborious; as well as enumerating through all the tables in sysobjects you end up enumerating through all the possible letters of the alphabet until you get a hit then you have to repeat the process for each character of the table name. There is, however, a little shortcut that looks like this:</p><pre class=\"code\">1<span style=\"color: gray\">and(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: magenta\">ascii</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: magenta\">lower</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: magenta\">substring</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">)))</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">xtype</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: red\">'u'</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: teal\">sq</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">desc</span><span style=\"color: gray\">))&gt;</span>109</pre><p>There’s a subtle but important difference here in that what’s it doing is rather than checking for an individual character match, it’s looking for where that character falls in the ASCII table. Actually, it’s first lowercasing the table name to ensure we’re only dealing with 26 characters (assuming alpha-only naming, of course), then it’s taking the ASCII value of that character. In the example above, it then checks to see if the character is further down the table than the letter “m” (ASCII 109) and then of course the same potential outcomes as described earlier apply (either a record comes back or it doesn’t). The main difference is that rather than potentially making 26 attempts at guessing the character (and consequently making 26 HTTP requests), it’s now going to exhaust all possibilities in only 5 – you just keep halving the possible ASCII character range until there’s only one possibility remaining.</p><p>For example, if greater than 109 then it must be between “n” and “z” so you split that (roughly) in half and go greater than 115. If that’s false then it must be between “t” and “z” so you split that bang in half and go greater than 112. That’s true so there’s only three chars left which you can narrow down to one in a max of two guesses. Bottom line is that the max of 26 guesses (call it average of 13) is now done in only 5 as you simply just keep halving the result set.</p><p>By constructing the right requests the app will still tell you everything it previously did in that very explicit, rich error message way, it’s just that it’s now being a little coy and you have to coax the answers out of it. This is frequently referred to as “Boolean-based” SQL injection and it works well where the previously demonstrated “Union-based” and “Error-based” approaches won’t fly. But it’s also not fool proof; let’s take a look at one more approach and this time we’re going to need to be a little more patient.</p><h4>Disclosure through patience: Time-based blind injection</h4><p>Everything to date has worked on the presumption that the app will disclose information via the HTML output. In the earlier examples the union-based and error-based approaches gave us data in the browser that explicitly told us object names and disclosed internal data. In the blind boolean-based examples we were<em>implicitly</em>told the same information by virtue of the HTML response being different based on a true versus a false equivalency test. But what happens when this information can’t be leaked via the HTML either explicitly or implicitly?</p><p>Let’s imagine another attack vector using this URL:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widgets/?OrderBy=Name</font></u></p><p>In this case it’s pretty fair to assume that the query will translate through to something like this:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">SELECT</span><span style=\"color: gray\">*</span><span style=\"color: blue\">FROM</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Widget</span><span style=\"color: blue\">ORDER BY</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Name</span></pre><p>Clearly we can’t just starting adding conditions directly into the ORDER BY clause (although there are other angles from which you could mount a boolean-based attack), so we need to try another approach. A common technique with SQLi is to terminate a statement and then append a subsequent one, for example like this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widgets/?OrderBy=Name;SELECT DB_NAME()</font></u></p><p>That’s a pretty innocuous one (although certainly discovering the database name can be useful), a more destructive approach would be to do something like “DROP TABLE Widget”. Of course the account the web app is connecting to the database with needs the rights to be able to do this, the point is that once you can start chaining together queries then the potential really starts to open up.</p><p>Getting back to blind SQLi though, what we need to do now is find another way to do the earlier boolean-based tests using a subsequent statement and the way we can do that is to introduce is a delay using the WAITFOR DELAY syntax. Try this on for size:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: teal\">Name</span><span style=\"color: gray\">;</span><span style=\"color: blue\">IF</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(EXISTS(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">*</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">xtype</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: red\">'u'</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: teal\">sq</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">desc</span><span style=\"color: gray\">) and</span><span style=\"color: magenta\">ascii</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: magenta\">lower</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: magenta\">substring</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">)))&gt;</span>109<span style=\"color: gray\">))</span><span style=\"color: blue\">WAITFOR DELAY</span><span style=\"color: red\">'0:0:5'</span></pre><p>This is only really a slight variation of the earlier examples in that rather than changing the number of records returned by manipulating the WHERE clause, it’s now just a totally new statement that looks for the presence of a table at the end of sysobjects beginning with a letter greater than “m” and if it exists, the query then takes a little nap for 5 seconds. We’d still need to narrow down the ASCII character range and we’d still need to move through each character of the table name<em>and</em>we’d still need to look at other tables in sysobjects (plus of course then look at syscolumns and then actually pull data out), but all of that is entirely possible with a bit of time. 5 seconds may be longer than needed or it may not be long enough, it all comes down to how consistent the response times from the app are because ultimately this is all designed to manipulate the observable behaviour which is how long it takes between making a request and receiving a response.</p><p>This attack – as with all the previous ones – could, of course, be entirely automated as it’s nothing more than simple enumerations and conditional logic. Of course it could end up taking a while but that’s a relative term; if a normal request takes 1 second and half of the 5 attempts required to find the right character return true then you’re looking at 17.5 seconds per character, say 10 chars in an average table name is about 3 minutes a table then maybe 20 tables in a DB so call it one hour and you’ve discovered every table name in the system. And that’s if you’re doing all this in a single-threaded fashion.</p><h4>It doesn’t end there…</h4><p>This is one of those topics with a heap of different angles, not least of which is because there are so many different combinations of database, app framework and web server not to mention a whole gamut of defences such as web application firewalls. An example of where things can get tricky is if you need to resort to a time-based attack yet the database doesn’t support a delay feature, for example an Access database (yes, some people actually do put these behind websites!) One approach here is to use what’s referred to as<a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc512676.aspx\">heavy queries</a>or in other words, queries which by their very nature will cause a response to be slow.</p><p>The other thing worth mentioning about SQLi is that two really significant factors play a role in the success an attacker has exploiting the risk: The first is input sanitisation in terms of what characters the app will actually accept and pass through to the database. Often we’ll see very piecemeal approaches where, for example, angle brackets and quotes are stripped but everything else is allowed. When this starts happening the attacker needs to get creative in terms of how they structure the query so that these roadblocks are avoided. And that’s kind of the second point – the attacker’s SQL prowess is vitally important. This goes well beyond just your average TSQL skills of SELECT FROM, the proficient SQL injector understands numerous tricks to both bypass the input sanitisation and select data from the system in such a way that it can be retrieved via the web UI. For example, little tricks like discovering a column type by using a query such as this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widget/?id=1 union select sum(instock) from widget</font></u></p><p>In this case, error-based injection will give tell you exactly what type the “InStock” column is when the error bubbles up to the UI (and no error will mean it’s numeric):</p><p><img width=\"500\" height=\"112\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Operand data type bit is invalid for sum operator.\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-c9drKzJTJyA/Ufd7LQfJsdI/AAAAAAAAFj0/QWXqQVSNtxw/image3.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Or once you’re totally fed up with the very presence of that damned vulnerable site still being up there on the web, a bit of this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widget/?id=1;shutdown</font></u></p><p>But injection goes a lot further than just pulling data out via HTTP, for example there are<a href=\"https://www.pentesterlab.com/from_sqli_to_shell/from_sqli_to_shell.pdf\">vectors that will grant the attacker shell on the machine</a>. Or take another tangent – why bother trying to suck stuff out through HTML when you might be able to just create a local SQL user and remotely connect using SQL Server Management Studio over port 1433? But hang on – you’d need the account the web app is connecting under to have the privileges to actually create users in the database, right? Yep, and plenty of them do, in fact you can find some of these<a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/search?num=100&safe=off&q=filetype%3Aconfig+inurl%3Aweb.config+inurl%3Aftp+%22user+id%3Dsa%22&oq=filetype%3Aconfig+inurl%3Aweb.config+inurl%3Aftp+%22user+id%3Dsa%22\">just by searching Google</a>(of course there is no need for SQLi in these cases, assuming the SQL servers are publicly accessible).</p><p>Lastly, if there’s any remaining doubt as to both the prevalence and impact of SQLi flaws in today’s software, just last week there was<a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9241084/SQL_flaws_remain_an_Achilles_heel_for_IT_security_groups\">news of what is arguably one of the largest hacking schemes to date</a>which (allegedly) resulted in losses of $300 million:</p><blockquote><p>The indictment also suggest that the hackers, in most cases, did not employ particularly sophisticated methods to gain initial entry into the corporate networks. The papers show that in most cases, the breach was made via SQL injection flaws -- a threat that has been thoroughly documented and understood for well over than a decade.</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps SQLi is not quite as well understood as some people think.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/xB6ZyrsX5Ps\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1535}}

Now remember – y’all play nice with the bits and pieces you’re about to read, ok?</p><p>SQL injection is a particularly interesting risk for a few different reasons:</p><ol><li>It’s getting increasingly harder to write vulnerable code due to frameworks that automatically parameterise inputs – yet we still write bad code.</li><li>You’re not necessarily in the clear just because you use stored procedures or a shiny ORM (you’re aware that<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/12/stored-procedures-and-orms-wont-save.html\">SQLi can still get through these</a>, right?) – we still build vulnerable apps around these mitigations.</li><li>It’s easily detected remotely by automated tools which can be orchestrated to crawl the web searching for vulnerable sites – yet we’re still putting them out there.</li></ol><p>It remains<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2010/05/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-1.html\">number one on the OWASP Top 10</a>for a very good reason – it’s common, it’s very easy to exploit and the impact of doing so is severe. One little injection risk in one little feature is often all it takes to disclose every piece of data in the whole system – and I’m going to show you how to do this yourself using a raft of different techniques.</p><p>I demonstrated how to protect against SQLi a couple of years back when I wrote about<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2010/05/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-1.html\">the OWASP Top 10 for .NET developers</a>so I’m not going to focus on mitigation here, this is all about exploiting. But enough of the boring defending stuff, let’s go break things!</p><a name='more'></a><h4>All your datas are belong to us (if we can break out of the query context)</h4><p>Let’s do a quick recap on what it is that makes SQLi possible. In a nutshell, it’s about breaking out of the<em>data</em>context and entering the<em>query</em>context. Let me visualise this for you; say you have URL that includes a query string parameter such as “id=1” and that parameter makes its way down into a SQL query such as this:</p><p align=\"left\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"103\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"SELECT * FROM Widget WHERE ID = 1\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-v8wf12yBReA/Ufd7GKiDAwI/AAAAAAAAFik/h1aZURZ2j7Q/Untitled-12.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>The entire URL probably looked something like this:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"110\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"http://widgetshop.com/Widget/?id=1\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-yJGNQFXQ8Jg/Ufd7Gs6hNPI/AAAAAAAAFis/EMvlU6I2FuQ/Untitled-22.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Pretty basic stuff, where it starts to get interesting is when you can manipulate the data in the URL such that it changes the value passed to the query. Ok, changing “1” to “2” will give you a different widget and that’s to be expected, but what if you did this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=1 or 1=1</font></u></p><p>That might then persist through to the database server like so:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">SELECT</span><span style=\"color: gray\">*</span><span style=\"color: blue\">FROM</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Widget</span><span style=\"color: blue\">WHERE</span><span style=\"color: teal\">ID</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">OR</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">=</span>1</pre><p>What this tells us is that the data is not being sanitised – in the examples above the ID should clearly be an integer yet the value “1 OR 1=1” has been accepted. More importantly though, because this data has simply been appended to the query<em>it has been able to change the function of the statement</em>. Rather than just selecting a single record, this query will now select<em>all</em>records as the “1=1” statement will always be true. Alternatively, we could force the page to return<em>no</em>records by changing “or 1=1” to “and 1=2” as it will always be false hence no results. Between these two alternatives we can easily assess if the app is at risk of an injection attack.</p><p>This is the essence of SQL injection – manipulating query execution with untrusted data – and it happens when developers do things like this:</p><p><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">query =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">\"SELECT * FROM Widget WHERE ID = \"</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">+ Request.QueryString[</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">\"ID\"</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">];<br></span><span style=\"background: white; color: green\">// Execute the query...</span></p><p>Of course what they should be doing is parameterising the untrusted data but I’m not going to go into that here (refer back to<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2010/05/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-1.html\">part one of my OWASP series</a>for more info on mitigation), instead I want to talk more about exploiting SQLi.</p><p>Ok, so that background covers how to demonstrate that a risk is present, but what can you now do with it? Let’s start exploring some common injection patterns.</p><h4>Joining the dots: Union query-based injection</h4><p>Let’s take an example where we expect a set of records to be returned to the page, in this case it’s a list of widgets of “TypeId” 1 on a URL like this:</p><p><font color=\"#0000ff\"><u>http://widgetshop.com/Widgets/?TypeId=1</u></font></p><p>The result on the page then looks like so:</p><p><img width=\"68\" height=\"117\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"3 widgets returned to the page\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-g7i0u59D7lE/Ufd7HFnj82I/AAAAAAAAFi0/GcgJwfnJYIQ/image6.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>We’d expect that query to look something like this once it hits the database:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">SELECT</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Name</span><span style=\"color: blue\">FROM</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Widget</span><span style=\"color: blue\">WHERE</span><span style=\"color: teal\">TypeId</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span>1</pre><p>But if we can apply what I’ve outlined above, namely that we might be able to just append SQL to the data in the query string, we might be able to do something like this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widgets/?TypeId=1 union all select name from sysobjects where xtype='u'</font></u></p><p>Which would then create a SQL query like so:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">SELECT</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Name</span><span style=\"color: blue\">FROM</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Widget</span><span style=\"color: blue\">WHERE</span><span style=\"color: teal\">TypeId</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span>1<span style=\"color: blue\">union</span><span style=\"color: gray\">all</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select</span><span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">xtype</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: red\">'u'</span></pre><p>Now keep in mind that the sysobjects table is the one that lists all the objects in the database and in this case we’re filtering that list by xtype “u” or in other words, user tables. When an injection risk is present that would mean the following output:</p><p><img width=\"66\" height=\"187\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"3 widgets returned to the page followed by 2 internal table names\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-A6YoNxkRaqc/Ufd7HrZDOXI/AAAAAAAAFi8/GfPVE2fE21E/image9.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is what’s referred to as a union query-based injection attack as we’ve simply appended an additional result set to the original and its made its way out directly into the HTML output – easy! Now that we know there’s a table called “User” we could do something like this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widgets/?TypeId=1 union all select password from [user]</font></u></p><p>SQL Server gets a bit uppity if the table name of “user” is not enclosed in square brackets given the word has other meanings in the DB sense. Regardless, here’s what that gives us:</p><p><img width=\"89\" height=\"148\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"3 widgets returned to the page followed by a password\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-vJk-tgqAQpg/Ufd7IFPK7lI/AAAAAAAAFjE/uhgNNX-YgWY/image2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Of course the UNION ALL statement only works when the first SELECT statement has the same number of columns as the second. That’s easily discoverable though, you just try going with a bit of ”union all select ‘a’” then if that fails “union all select ‘a’, ‘b’” and so on. Basically you’re just guessing the number of columns until things work.</p><p>We could go on and on down this path and pull back all sorts of other data, let’s move on to the next attack though. There are times when a union-based attack isn’t going to play ball either due to sanitisation of the input or how the data is appended to the query or even how the result set is displayed to the page. To get around that we’re going to need to get a bit more creative.</p><h4>Making the app squeal: Error-based injection</h4><p>Let’s try another pattern – what if we did this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=1 or x=1</font></u></p><p>Hang on, that’s not valid SQL syntax, the “x=1” piece won’t compute, at least not unless there’s a column called “x” so won’t it just throw an exception? Precisely, in fact it means you’ll see an exception like this:</p><p><img width=\"845\" height=\"187\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Invalid column name 'x'\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-iSzrFMeO-dw/Ufd7InmwlzI/AAAAAAAAFjM/u-o_hoEoAuM/image14.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This an ASP.NET error and other frameworks have similar paradigms but the important thing is that the error message is disclosing information about the internal implementation, namely that there is no column called “x”. Why is this important? It’s fundamentally important because once you establish that an app is leaking SQL exceptions, you can do things like this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=convert(int,(select top 1 name from sysobjects where id=(select top 1 id from (select top 1 id from sysobjects where xtype='u' order by id) sq order by id DESC)))</font></u></p><p>That’s a lot to absorb and I’ll come back to it in more detail, the important thing is though that it will yield this result in the browser:<p><img width=\"844\" height=\"184\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'Widget' to data type int.\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-mM4agaXM6Cg/Ufd7JQvO_fI/AAAAAAAAFjU/tmIarbT7t_w/image17.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>And there we have it, we’ve now discovered that there is a table in the database called “Widget”. You’ll often see this referred to as “Error-based SQL injection” due to the dependency on internal errors. Let’s deconstruct the query from the URL:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: magenta\">convert</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">int</span><span style=\"color: gray\">, (</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">xtype</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: red\">'u'</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: teal\">sq</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">DESC</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)))</span></pre><p>Working from the deepest nesting up, get the first record ID from the sysobjects table after ordering by ID. From that collection, get the<em>last</em>ID (this is why it orders in descending) and pass that into the top select statement. That top statement is then only going to take the table name<em>and try to convert it to an integer</em>. The conversion to integer will almost certainly fail (please people, don’t name your tables “1” or “2” or any other integer for that matter!) and that exception then discloses the table name in the UI.</p><p>Why three select statements? Because it means we can go into that innermost one and change “top 1” to “top 2” which then gives us this result:</p><p><img width=\"844\" height=\"185\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'User' to data type int.\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-GJZJi34IK1Q/Ufd7J5OtHmI/AAAAAAAAFjc/XnioL8T3rvo/image20.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Now we know that there’s a table called “User” in the database. Using this approach we can discover all the column names of each table (just apply the same logic to the syscolumns table). We can then extend that logic even further to select data from table columns:</p><p><img width=\"844\" height=\"184\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'P@ssw0rd' to data type int.\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-QDCJLdU038g/Ufd7KXKELeI/AAAAAAAAFjk/XwdEg1W2yyI/image26.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>In the screen above, I’d already been able to discover that there was a table called “User” and a column called “Password”, all I needed to do was select out of that table (and again, you can enumerate through all records one by one with nested select statements), and cause an exception by attempting to convert the string to an int (you can always append an alpha char to the data if it<em>really is</em>an int then attempt to convert the whole lot to an int which will cause an exception). If you want to get a sense of just how easy this can be, I recorded a<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/10/hacking-is-childs-play-sql-injection.html\">little video last year where I teach my 3 year old to automate this with Havij</a>which uses the technique.</p><p>But there’s a problem with all this – it was only possible because the app was a bit naughty and exposed internal error messages to the general public. In fact the app quite literally<em>told us</em>the names of the tables and columns and then disclosed the data when we asked the right questions, but what happens when it doesn’t? I mean what happens when the app is correctly configured so as not to leak the details of internal exceptions?</p><p>This is where we get into “blind” SQL injection which is the genuinely interesting stuff.</p><h4>Hacking blind</h4><p>In the examples above (and indeed in many precedents of successful injection attacks), the attacks are dependent on the vulnerable app explicitly disclosing internal details either by joining tables and returning the data to the UI or by raising exceptions that bubble up to the browser. Leaking of internal implementations is always a bad thing and as you saw earlier, security misconfigurations such as this can be leveraged to disclose more than just the application structure, you can actually pull<em>data</em>out through this channel as well.</p><p>A correctly configured app<em>should</em>return a message more akin to this one here when an<em>unhandled</em>exception occurs:</p><p><img width=\"845\" height=\"255\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Error. An error occurred while processing your request.\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-IN_JPtT0ZVc/Ufd7Ky6aXZI/AAAAAAAAFjs/cKXM5z4S7SQ/image29.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is the default error page from a brand new ASP.NET app with custom errors configured but again, similar paradigms exist in other technology stacks. Now this page is exactly the same as the earlier ones that showed the internal SQL exceptions but rather than letting them bubble up to the UI they’re being hidden and a friendly error message shown instead. Assuming we also couldn’t exploit a union-based attack, the SQLi risk is entirely gone, right? Not quite…</p><p>Blind SQLi relies on us getting a lot more<em>implicit</em>or in other words, drawing our conclusions based on other observations we can make about the behaviour of the app that aren’t quite as direct as telling us table names or showing column data directly in the browser by way of unions or unhandled exceptions. Of course this now begs the question – how can we make the app behave in an observable fashion such that it discloses the information we had earlier without explicitly telling us?</p><p>We’re going to look at two approaches here: boolean-based and time-based.</p><h4>Ask, and you shall be told: Boolean-based injection</h4><p>This all comes down to asking the right questions of the app. Earlier on, we could explicitly ask questions such as “What tables do you have” or “What columns do you have in each table” and the database would explicitly tell us. Now we need to ask a little bit differently, for example like this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/widget/?id=1 and 1=2</font></u></p><p>Clearly this equivalency test can never be true – one will never be equal to two. How an app at risk of injection responds to this request is the cornerstone of blind SQLi and it can happen in one of two different ways.</p><p>Firstly, it might just throw an exception if no record is returned. Often developers will<em>assume</em>that a record referred to in a query string exists because it’s usually the app itself that has provided the link based on pulling it out of the database on another page. When there’s no record returned, things break. Secondly, the app<em>might not</em>throw an exception but then it also won’t display a record either because the equivalency is false. Either way, the app is implicitly telling us that no records were returned from the database.</p><p>Now let’s try this:</p><pre class=\"code\">1<span style=\"color: gray\">and(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: magenta\">substring</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">xtype</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: red\">'u'</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: teal\">sq</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">desc</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)) =</span><span style=\"color: red\">'a'</span></pre><p>Keeping in mind that this entire block replaces<em>just the query string value</em>so instead of “?id=1” it becomes “?id=1 and…”, it’s actually only a minor variation on the earlier requests intended to retrieve table names. In fact the main different is that rather than attempting to cause an exception by converting a string to an integer, it’s now an equivalency test to see if the first character of the table name is an “a” (we’re assuming a case-insensitive collation here). If this request gives us the same result as “?id=1” then it confirms that the first table in sysobjects does indeed begin with an “a” as the equivalency has held true. If it gives us one of the earlier mentioned two scenarios (an error or shows no record), then we know that the table<em>doesn’t</em>begin with an “a” as no record has been returned.</p><p>Now all of that only gives us the first character of the table name from sysobjects, when you want the second character then the substring statement needs to progress to the next position:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: magenta\">substring</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>2<span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=(</span></pre><p>You can see it now starts at position 2 rather than position 1. Of course this is laborious; as well as enumerating through all the tables in sysobjects you end up enumerating through all the possible letters of the alphabet until you get a hit then you have to repeat the process for each character of the table name. There is, however, a little shortcut that looks like this:</p><pre class=\"code\">1<span style=\"color: gray\">and(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: magenta\">ascii</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: magenta\">lower</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: magenta\">substring</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">)))</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">xtype</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: red\">'u'</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: teal\">sq</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">desc</span><span style=\"color: gray\">))&gt;</span>109</pre><p>There’s a subtle but important difference here in that what’s it doing is rather than checking for an individual character match, it’s looking for where that character falls in the ASCII table. Actually, it’s first lowercasing the table name to ensure we’re only dealing with 26 characters (assuming alpha-only naming, of course), then it’s taking the ASCII value of that character. In the example above, it then checks to see if the character is further down the table than the letter “m” (ASCII 109) and then of course the same potential outcomes as described earlier apply (either a record comes back or it doesn’t). The main difference is that rather than potentially making 26 attempts at guessing the character (and consequently making 26 HTTP requests), it’s now going to exhaust all possibilities in only 5 – you just keep halving the possible ASCII character range until there’s only one possibility remaining.</p><p>For example, if greater than 109 then it must be between “n” and “z” so you split that (roughly) in half and go greater than 115. If that’s false then it must be between “t” and “z” so you split that bang in half and go greater than 112. That’s true so there’s only three chars left which you can narrow down to one in a max of two guesses. Bottom line is that the max of 26 guesses (call it average of 13) is now done in only 5 as you simply just keep halving the result set.</p><p>By constructing the right requests the app will still tell you everything it previously did in that very explicit, rich error message way, it’s just that it’s now being a little coy and you have to coax the answers out of it. This is frequently referred to as “Boolean-based” SQL injection and it works well where the previously demonstrated “Union-based” and “Error-based” approaches won’t fly. But it’s also not fool proof; let’s take a look at one more approach and this time we’re going to need to be a little more patient.</p><h4>Disclosure through patience: Time-based blind injection</h4><p>Everything to date has worked on the presumption that the app will disclose information via the HTML output. In the earlier examples the union-based and error-based approaches gave us data in the browser that explicitly told us object names and disclosed internal data. In the blind boolean-based examples we were<em>implicitly</em>told the same information by virtue of the HTML response being different based on a true versus a false equivalency test. But what happens when this information can’t be leaked via the HTML either explicitly or implicitly?</p><p>Let’s imagine another attack vector using this URL:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widgets/?OrderBy=Name</font></u></p><p>In this case it’s pretty fair to assume that the query will translate through to something like this:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">SELECT</span><span style=\"color: gray\">*</span><span style=\"color: blue\">FROM</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Widget</span><span style=\"color: blue\">ORDER BY</span><span style=\"color: teal\">Name</span></pre><p>Clearly we can’t just starting adding conditions directly into the ORDER BY clause (although there are other angles from which you could mount a boolean-based attack), so we need to try another approach. A common technique with SQLi is to terminate a statement and then append a subsequent one, for example like this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widgets/?OrderBy=Name;SELECT DB_NAME()</font></u></p><p>That’s a pretty innocuous one (although certainly discovering the database name can be useful), a more destructive approach would be to do something like “DROP TABLE Widget”. Of course the account the web app is connecting to the database with needs the rights to be able to do this, the point is that once you can start chaining together queries then the potential really starts to open up.</p><p>Getting back to blind SQLi though, what we need to do now is find another way to do the earlier boolean-based tests using a subsequent statement and the way we can do that is to introduce is a delay using the WAITFOR DELAY syntax. Try this on for size:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: teal\">Name</span><span style=\"color: gray\">;</span><span style=\"color: blue\">IF</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(EXISTS(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">*</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: blue\">select top</span>1<span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">from</span><span style=\"color: green\">sysobjects</span><span style=\"color: blue\">where</span><span style=\"color: teal\">xtype</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: red\">'u'</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)</span><span style=\"color: teal\">sq</span><span style=\"color: blue\">order by</span><span style=\"color: teal\">id</span><span style=\"color: blue\">desc</span><span style=\"color: gray\">) and</span><span style=\"color: magenta\">ascii</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: magenta\">lower</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: magenta\">substring</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: teal\">name</span><span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">,</span>1<span style=\"color: gray\">)))&gt;</span>109<span style=\"color: gray\">))</span><span style=\"color: blue\">WAITFOR DELAY</span><span style=\"color: red\">'0:0:5'</span></pre><p>This is only really a slight variation of the earlier examples in that rather than changing the number of records returned by manipulating the WHERE clause, it’s now just a totally new statement that looks for the presence of a table at the end of sysobjects beginning with a letter greater than “m” and if it exists, the query then takes a little nap for 5 seconds. We’d still need to narrow down the ASCII character range and we’d still need to move through each character of the table name<em>and</em>we’d still need to look at other tables in sysobjects (plus of course then look at syscolumns and then actually pull data out), but all of that is entirely possible with a bit of time. 5 seconds may be longer than needed or it may not be long enough, it all comes down to how consistent the response times from the app are because ultimately this is all designed to manipulate the observable behaviour which is how long it takes between making a request and receiving a response.</p><p>This attack – as with all the previous ones – could, of course, be entirely automated as it’s nothing more than simple enumerations and conditional logic. Of course it could end up taking a while but that’s a relative term; if a normal request takes 1 second and half of the 5 attempts required to find the right character return true then you’re looking at 17.5 seconds per character, say 10 chars in an average table name is about 3 minutes a table then maybe 20 tables in a DB so call it one hour and you’ve discovered every table name in the system. And that’s if you’re doing all this in a single-threaded fashion.</p><h4>It doesn’t end there…</h4><p>This is one of those topics with a heap of different angles, not least of which is because there are so many different combinations of database, app framework and web server not to mention a whole gamut of defences such as web application firewalls. An example of where things can get tricky is if you need to resort to a time-based attack yet the database doesn’t support a delay feature, for example an Access database (yes, some people actually do put these behind websites!) One approach here is to use what’s referred to as<a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc512676.aspx\">heavy queries</a>or in other words, queries which by their very nature will cause a response to be slow.</p><p>The other thing worth mentioning about SQLi is that two really significant factors play a role in the success an attacker has exploiting the risk: The first is input sanitisation in terms of what characters the app will actually accept and pass through to the database. Often we’ll see very piecemeal approaches where, for example, angle brackets and quotes are stripped but everything else is allowed. When this starts happening the attacker needs to get creative in terms of how they structure the query so that these roadblocks are avoided. And that’s kind of the second point – the attacker’s SQL prowess is vitally important. This goes well beyond just your average TSQL skills of SELECT FROM, the proficient SQL injector understands numerous tricks to both bypass the input sanitisation and select data from the system in such a way that it can be retrieved via the web UI. For example, little tricks like discovering a column type by using a query such as this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widget/?id=1 union select sum(instock) from widget</font></u></p><p>In this case, error-based injection will give tell you exactly what type the “InStock” column is when the error bubbles up to the UI (and no error will mean it’s numeric):</p><p><img width=\"500\" height=\"112\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Operand data type bit is invalid for sum operator.\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-c9drKzJTJyA/Ufd7LQfJsdI/AAAAAAAAFj0/QWXqQVSNtxw/image3.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Or once you’re totally fed up with the very presence of that damned vulnerable site still being up there on the web, a bit of this:</p><p><u><font color=\"#0000ff\">http://widgetshop.com/Widget/?id=1;shutdown</font></u></p><p>But injection goes a lot further than just pulling data out via HTTP, for example there are<a href=\"https://www.pentesterlab.com/from_sqli_to_shell/from_sqli_to_shell.pdf\">vectors that will grant the attacker shell on the machine</a>. Or take another tangent – why bother trying to suck stuff out through HTML when you might be able to just create a local SQL user and remotely connect using SQL Server Management Studio over port 1433? But hang on – you’d need the account the web app is connecting under to have the privileges to actually create users in the database, right? Yep, and plenty of them do, in fact you can find some of these<a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/search?num=100&safe=off&q=filetype%3Aconfig+inurl%3Aweb.config+inurl%3Aftp+%22user+id%3Dsa%22&oq=filetype%3Aconfig+inurl%3Aweb.config+inurl%3Aftp+%22user+id%3Dsa%22\">just by searching Google</a>(of course there is no need for SQLi in these cases, assuming the SQL servers are publicly accessible).</p><p>Lastly, if there’s any remaining doubt as to both the prevalence and impact of SQLi flaws in today’s software, just last week there was<a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9241084/SQL_flaws_remain_an_Achilles_heel_for_IT_security_groups\">news of what is arguably one of the largest hacking schemes to date</a>which (allegedly) resulted in losses of $300 million:</p><blockquote><p>The indictment also suggest that the hackers, in most cases, did not employ particularly sophisticated methods to gain initial entry into the corporate networks. The papers show that in most cases, the breach was made via SQL injection flaws -- a threat that has been thoroughly documented and understood for well over than a decade.</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps SQLi is not quite as well understood as some people think.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/xB6ZyrsX5Ps\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1588}}

This led to an intense flurry of activity, by which I mean four people asked me about it.</p><p>Although the Private Eye story wasn't completely wrong – I have stopped doing this particular column for a while, for reasons I'll explain in a moment – I was all set to write to their letters page to whine in the most pompous manner imaginable, something I've always secretly wanted to do, when I figured I might as well respond here instead, for money.</p><p>Incidentally, I'm aware this is Olympic-level navel gazing, but you're a human being with free will who can stop reading any time. Here, have a full stop. And another. And another. There are exits all over this building.</p><p>Anyway, I haven't quit the newspaper, but I have, for the meantime, stopped writing weekly, partly because my overall workload was making that kind of timetable impossible, and partly because I've recently been overwhelmed by the sheer amount of jabber in the world: a vast cloud of blah I felt I was contributing to every seven days.</p><p>If a weatherman misreads the national mood and cheerfully sieg-heils on BBC Breakfast at 8.45am, there'll be 86 outraged columns, 95 despairing blogs, half a million wry tweets and a rib-tickling pass-the-parcel Photoshop meme about it circulating by lunchtime. It happens every day. Every day, a billion instantly conjured words on any contemporaneous subject you can think of. Events and noise, events and noise; everything was starting to resemble nothing but events and noise. Firing more words into the middle of all that began to strike me as futile and unnecessary. I started to view myself as yet another factory mindlessly pumping carbon dioxide into a toxic sky.</p><p>This is perhaps not the ideal state of mind for someone writing a weekly column in a newspaper. Clearly it was time for a short break.</p><p>Reader comments form part of the overall wordstorm described above, and it's true I'm not a huge fan of them, but that's chiefly because I'm an elderly man from the age of steam who clings irrationally to the outmoded belief that articles and letters pages should be kept separate, just like church and state. I guess conceptually I still think I'm writing in a \"newspaper\", even though the reality of what that means has changed beyond measure since I started doing it. So now I'm sitting grumpily in a spaceship with my arms folded, wearing a stovepipe hat. Ridiculous.</p><p>These days most newspaper sites are geared towards encouraging interaction with the minuscule fraction of readers who bother to interact back, which is a pity because I'm selfishly uninterested in conducting any kind of meaningful dialogue with humankind in general. I'd say Twitter's better for back-and-forth discussion anyway, if you could be arsed with it. Yelling out the window at passersby is another option.</p><p>When it comes to comments, despite not being as funny as I never was in the first place, I get an incredibly easy ride from passing wellwishers compared with any woman who dares write anything on the internet anywhere about anything at all, the ugly bitch, boo, go home bitch go home. Getting slagged off online is par for the course, and absorbing the odd bit of constructive criticism is character-building. The positive comments are more unsettling. Who needs to see typed applause accompanying an article? It's just weird. I don't get it.</p><p>But then right now I don't \"get\" most forms of communication. There's just so much of it. Everybody talking at once and all over each other; everyone on the planet typing words into their computers, for ever, like I'm doing now. I fail to see the point of roughly 98% of human communication at the moment, which indicates I need to stroll around somewhere quiet for a bit.</p><p>After my break, and a rethink, I'll quietly return later in the year, to write something slightly different, slightly less regularly (probably fortnightly). In other words, I'm reducing my carbon emissions. And whatever the new thing I'm writing turns out to be, it'll appear both online, still accompanied by the requisite string of comments, and in the newspaper, which is a foldable thing made of paper, containing words and pictures, which catches fire easily and is sometimes left on trains.</p><p>Now get out.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/digital-media\">Digital media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers\">Newspapers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing\">Newspapers&magazines</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media\">Social media</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/charliebrooker\">Charlie Brooker</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a>© 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So I thought I would respond here to all the comments at once.</p><p>Some stats about our hiring process:</p><ul><li><img style=\"float: right; display: inline\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.digilant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/blindfold-typing1.jpg\">We worked with 2 recruitment agencies, looking for a 5+ years experience in C#/.NET, Server Side work, OSS experience / NoSQL experience, multi threading, TCP/IP, REST…<li>We got 23 CVs to review, and did phone interviews for most of them.<li>We actually interviewed 9 candidates, had 3 potential hires and made an offer to 2 of them.</li></ul><p><strong>Unprofessional</strong>– I don’t know about you, but a large part of running a business is finding good people. And having people that are<em>severely</em>under qualified show up is a problem. In the same way that I talk about problems in code or silly patterns or horrible processes, the part about hiring people is just as important. I am quite careful about not giving away any details, but that is about it. I’ve had people comment that I am gloating. But nothing could be further from the truth, if anything, those are mournful posts. Because if<em>that</em>is the state of the industry…</p><p><strong>Those are insulting questions</strong>– a few people said that they thought that the questions were insulting.<em>Look</em>at the numbers, we had<em>two thirds</em>of the people fail to answer them. I had a candidate with 13+ years of experience who looked quite promising get up and leave mid interview because the candidate couldn’t solve a string sort problem with full internet access. I had people submit code that made my eyes bleed.  And I think that people don’t understand something about those questions. The coding questions won’t get you hired. The coding questions are there to keep you from<em>getting</em>hired. The assumption is that you should be able to solve those questions blindfolded while dancing the cha-cha and typing with your left earlobe.</p><p>Due to the large number of people who can talk the talk but not walk the walk, I am assuming all candidates incompetent until proven otherwise. And yes, I absolutely agree that this is a sad state of affairs.</p><p><strong>Those are not relevant questions</strong>– “In these days on the Internet, I'm not at all sure I do care someone knows how to sort a string.” Well, we<em>are</em>building databases, we actually care quite a lot about things like sorting. But leaving that aside, we don’t actually care how you do the sorting. Most candidate uses List&lt;T&gt;.Sort, and that was fine. But I think that the key point is, if you have internet access and an hour, and you can’t implement a sort algorithm,<em>you don’t get to work here</em>.</p><p><strong>You should be mentoring them, not discouraging them</strong>– I think that someone just missed a turn in the road to reality. I didn’t show up at a Teach Kids to Program and laughed at their inability to do three stars code. I was conducting interviews for a senior position. That meant that I was limiting candidates to 5+ years experience. Actually going through the interview process cost us. A lot. It effectively shut us down for a day or two, and took about three full days just to do the interviews.  There is a serious cost here.</p><p>And having people that are<em>drastically</em>unqualified show up and take our time is a very costly waste. Look at the number above. Out of 23 people, I posted about 3, because they crossed all the limits that I can think of. In contrast, we had a bunch of other people we talked to or even interviewed that didn’t make the cut for being potential hires. They weren’t bad by any means, but they just weren’t what we were looking for.</p><p>I am not sorry, if you don’t show up ready to answer stuff that a first year student should be able to, you are cheating. Certainly me, and probably yourself.

Yes, I know the doll looks female. But for our purposes it is a Zombie female named Boris.</p><p>I hired Boris at the end of 2011. She was hired for a junior position in HR after some doubts on my parts. Mainly, she didn’t shine in the hiring process, but we really needed the additional manpower, and she didn’t have anything that was an immediate NO. Just nothing that made me want to say an immediate YES.</p><p>We started Boris using pretty much the same way we start junior devs, learning the ropes by doing some non essential tasks. In Boris’ case, that was done by building the public daily builds site for us. I thought it was a good way to getting started, it meant getting surface familiarity with RavenDB, and it was something that we needed. By the way, we have since then replaced that site, don’t bother looking for that.</p><p>Boris needed a lot of help at first, but that was natural for a new hire, especially a junior one. We spent quite a bit of time with her, showing her the ropes, how things work, etc. But it took her a<em>long</em>time to do things, and in the end, it was quite apparent that it would be easier to do things myself than tell Boris to do them.</p><p>If I did things myself, it would be done. If I told Boris to do them, I would have to explain what I wanted, come over and help several times, come over again and fix the broken pieces. Explain some more about what was wrong, and finally pretty much write it myself. Now, that is something that I am perfectly fine with, for the first two times. The third and forth times, maybe. But if you don’t get what is going on after a few explanation, there are two options. Either Boris couldn’t get it, or I wasn’t explaining things in a way Boris could get it.</p><p>Either way, it didn’t matter, Boris didn’t get it. And even assuming that the fault lie in me, which I am absolutely willing to do. That didn’t really matter.</p><p>About 3 months after we hired her, Boris was let go with our best wishes, but without any regrets. In fact, my major regret was letting it go for so long, because I really didn’t want to admit that Boris was a bad fit.</p><p>Now, let us review what Boris cost us:</p><ul><li>3 months of salary& benefits.<li><em>Not</em>hiring someone else that could have done better.<li>Quite a lot of my and the other guys’ time.</li></ul><p>It doesn’t really matter how you spin it, Boris was a huge net loss for us. Not theoretical “I could have that” loss, but a real measurable loss that set us back by quite a bit.</p><p>On the other hand, we have had a recruiting cycle that didn’t pan out. The end result that we didn’t get anyone. Net loss, purely theoretical from our part. We reached out to a partner and got help from known good people.</p><p>What I think is crucial to understand is that I actually have access to a really good group of people that I can work with. Most of them are remote, and most of them are only available for part of the time. But getting<em>really</em>good people, and I mean<em>awesome</em>people, of the kind that “you just blew my mind” people is not a big deal. I have access to them, and if I have enough work for that level of talent, I can probably get them for several months of pure work. I don’t shy around or talk behind people’s back, and when I tell you that they have world’s class talent. I mean it.</p><p>When I am looking for local people, I am looking for people that can compete with<em>that</em>level of talent. Because remote work is useful and great, but it ain’t the same. And that is why every now and then we do a recruiting cycle, to see if we can find people that match our expectations.</p><p>In other words, the cost of making a bad hire would be money and time (much more costly!) down the drain. The cost of not making a hire is having to rely on<em>good</em>people that might live in a different timezone or take vacations on a strange schedule.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~4/fpMlTXLQW-g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1853}}

Besieged by pretenders, he had devised an online coding test and hired a recruitment firm to subject candidates to it in hopes of weeding out the lower-quality developers. Since RJ and a teammate had to assess each candidate by themselves, the test was an important time-saver: if the candidate's code wouldn't even compile, refused to run, or obviously didn't work, that was an easy write-off. But this story wouldn't be much of a WTF if it were merely about some feckless applicant.</p><p>One day they received a submission from a Mrs. Qiu Jiang. Her code not only compiled and ran, it actually worked. It passed RJ's test cases quickly too, which meant Qiu hadn't simply brute-forced her way through. RJ had high hopes for their face-to-face interview.</p><p>Qiu's first language was Cantonese, and she spoke English well enough, but mere language barriers couldn't account for her inability to answer even the simplest of RJ's technical questions. He rephrased and repeated even led a little, baffled by how at-odds Qiu's apparent knowledge was with her coding submission. In the end, RJ thanked Mrs. Jiang for her time and sent her on her way. RJ briefly considered reaching out to the recruitment firm to find out how this had happened, weeks went by, candidates came and went, and he mostly forgot about Qiu.</p><p>Then came the submission from John. John was a gem of a developer - his code was close to perfect and he was even better in person. After shaking his hand and letting him know they'd be in touch, RJ hurried to his colleague's desk to let him know they at long last had a winner. However, while he was walking his teammate through John's submission, something nagged at him. It seemed...familiar. He went back to John's résumé and all the pieces fell into place.</p><p>It was right there at the top bold and center-aligned: John<em>Jiang</em>.</p><p>RJ dug through the pile on his desk until he found Qiu Jiang's submission: sure enough, the code was almost identical to that of her husband. Now her poor showing in the interview made sense: there was only one developer in the family.</p><p>Wondering how they'd let<em>this</em>slip through the cracks, RJ called the recruitment firm. They didn't seem surprised when he described the Jiang Problem, though. The recruiter drone told RJ this was standard procedure: they got a substantially higher commission for placing a female candidate.<em>Especially</em>if English is her second language.</p><p>RJ had a few choice words for the company he'd partnered with. But the RJ Test had proved its worth yet again: this time, teaching him something about the quality of his recruiter.</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

Very cool to see code reuse, but also a good experience replicated. Kudos to the SkyDrive team for recognizing a good thing and putting it into production. It'll be interesting to see where else this editor pops up in the future.</p><br/><hr/>©2013 Scott Hanselman.
